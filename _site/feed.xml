    <description>Hey, I'm Matthew. This site is just me thinking on the Internet, processing and commenting on whatever it is that I read and learn. I get paid by New Relic to learn how to code better, and I like reading about most of the things.</description>

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Do it for the looooove</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a meetup at Mozilla the other day. I had a lot of trouble finding the event because Mozilla has a couple of different offices in the building that they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually found a Mozilla employee and told him that I was looking for an event there. He asked me if I meant some other event. I can’t remember the name, so let’s call if CoolFunTime. So he asked if I meant CoolFunTime. I didn’t, but I said “yeah, maybe” and followed him through the maze of offices on that side of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a really awkward conversation along the way. It was pretty much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, do you work at Mozilla?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another minute of silence and walking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that thrillfest, we made it to the door leading to the event. He used his keycard to open the door, and I walked into a party thing—music, food, drinks, and mostly attractive people on the patio of the office looking out over the Easy Bay. It felt like cool kid corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s virtually zero chance that this is the meetup, I thought to myself. These meetups, especially this HTML5 game one that I was going to, are typically not super well-attended events. And for the smaller ones like this one, there’s certainly not typically music, drinks, or food.  I told the guy that this was not the event that I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my phone for more details and told him that I was looking for the “Foxhole.” He seemed to know what that meant, so we went to the clear other side of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He opened the door, and I was met with a gray, drab room with about thirty shitty chairs and three people. Bingo! The striking difference between the events made me start giggling to myself like a weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetup was pretty cool. The topic of HTML5 games was cool, and it was really neat to see some of the games that can now be played in your browser. That’s in the friggin’ BROWSER, guys.  It’s amazing how advanced it’s all getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference in the two events, though—it me to thinking about why I’m doing this coding thing. Obviously, programmers are in high demand, especially here in San Francisco. If you can code really well, you’re golden. These people can work their magic and make some really cool stuff that will make some companies a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they’re pampered. They’re making a lot of money. They work in cool offices that might overlook the Bay or be in the heart of downtown San Francisco. And they get events thrown for them, like the CoolFunTime event I accidentally walked into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Relic throws some similar events. Last week, we had a 50’s-themed happy hour with food, music and drinks. And I’m sure a lot of the companies in the area throw similar events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun, but that’s not why I want to be programming. And it’s important to remember that that’s not why I want to be programming. It’s cool to be pampered and appreciated, and the people at CoolFunTime were enjoying being pampered after a week of work at Mozilla. But it’s also probably pretty easy to get into a stasis if I get really excited about the pampering—putting in the eight hours of work and then going off to do other things that don’t involve code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the people in the not-super-well-lit, drab Foxhole are the ones who are really hustling. Most of them have day jobs, and then they’re spending a good chunk of their Friday night going to a small event because they love making games, want to get better at it, and want to talk to other people like them. It’s awesome, and it’s inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the kind of people I want to surround myself with. With whom I want to surround myself—sorry. The people who want to spend their nights coding. The people who want to build things, to hone their craft, and to make the things that they’ve always wanted to see or to use or to play. They’re the ones who will get really good at coding, and they’re the ones who will push me to become a better coder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re doing it for the love. The love that they get from learning and from writing cool programs. Not the love that they get from the bottom of a bottle. (Yeah? Smile Empty Soul, right, guys? Right? And it kind of comes into play with the love of the pampering with the parties and the drinks? I thought it was pretty good.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guys, I Finished</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I graduated from Dev Bootcamp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything went really well on Friday. We had four groups, and we ended up with four awesome projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My group went first, and we presented Bookmeetups. I think everyone sounded confident, and the presentation was crisp and concise. Plus, the project turned out way cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next group to go was Armando’s team, Glucose Amigo. This app was designed to help those with diabetes to track their sugar as well as send their scores to their doctors. It turned out to be an awesome app, and the team presented extremely well. They had the crowd laughing most of the time, and they still managed to teach us all about their application and show off the features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny and his team went next. They presented their application: Feed.me. You know how it’s always really difficult for a group or a person to decide where to go eat because everyone always says “I don’t care!”? Well, with this app, you click a button, and based on your Facebook information, it recommends a single restaurant choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last app to go was Irene’’s BetterBet. This is an accountability app. I say what goal I want to achieve, and then I put money down. I make a bet with someone that I will stick to the goal. Maybe I’ll put $10 down that I need to work out 5 times this week. If I do it, I don’t lose $10, but if I don’t, the $10 goes to my accountability buddy. We don’t want to lose money, and it’s actually on the line, so we’re better about our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the presentations were awesome. All of the groups were awesome. We all still suck at code, but it’s amazing to see how far we came in nine weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Bootcamp transformed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came into Dev Bootcamp nine weeks ago as someone who just didn’t feel at ease. I couldn’t relax because I felt like I didn’t know anything. I felt boring. I was scared of my future. I didn’t think that I would ever have a job that I cared about. I was scared to speak loudly. I had next to nil confidence. I was a mess. I was unhappy with myself, and I felt that I was always searching. I didn’t love myself, and that makes it extremely difficult to love other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dev Bootcamp, though, I tried the “fake it ‘til you make it” stuff. I pretended to be confident and interesting, and then something happened. I started to be the real Matthew. I was loud. I made jokes. I started singing a lot, like I always do around my family and close friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences and small quirks are celebrated here. The boots are encouraged to be themselves, to expose their ignorance, and to be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that let me be me. I was real Matthew, and people responded well. So I gained confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to build real things out of nothing. I gained technical skills instead of some business skills. The accounting and finance skills that I learned didn’t really allow me to make anything, and I felt that I wasn’t actually contributing to society. But now I get to be creative and make stuff. So I gained confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about my future now. I know that I’m going to find a job, and I know that I’ll be working on building cool things. I’m going to get paid to continue learning and to have fun. What could be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don’t feel much of a connection with my college. I didn’t feel much connection to my high school. I want to devote zero time and zero money to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dev Bootcamp is different. I want to make this awesome place even better. I’ll eventually have a job, but I can’t wait to come into DBC on nights and weekends to help out the boots. I can’t wait to share my ideas on how DBC can become even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited for the future. I’ll get to help out at Dev Bootcamp. I’ll get to be employed doing something I really enjoy. I’ll get to be near most of the fantastic people I met here. And I’ll finally have money to fly out to see Grace! It still sucks that we can’t be together, but it’ll be great to have the ability to fly out and see her any weekend I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, Dev Bootcamp rules.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wednesday and Thursday, Week 9: Nearly There</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, there’s a very real chance that this has been the hardest that I’ve ever worked during a five-day stretch. The work hours haven’t been a whole lot worse than they have been for the rest of DBC, but I haven’t been able to sleep much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been anxious. About all of the things. I’ve been anxious about the final project. I want it to be something that I’m extremely proud to show off. Everyone in the team (and everyone in the other teams, I’m sure) has been running on fumes for the past few days. We’re pumping out code, but it’s not as quickly or with the same quality as when we’re at 100%. Everything took a little bit longer, naps and breaks became more frequent, and coffee was relied on pretty heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been anxious about the presentations. Even though they’re only ten-minute presentations—during which I’ll talk for a maximum of three minutes—I’m very uneasy about giving them. I’ve never been excited to give a presentation. I always worry that I’ll freeze up or say something stupid. There’s not as much pressure now—even if we completely melt down,  we’ll still graduate and will be ready to get jobs—but I still want to put out the best work that I can. Typically, the worrying and stressing about presentations helps me. I’ll rehearse and really think through what I want to say, so they usually go pretty well. Still, though, it’s not awesome to feel anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve been anxious about life after DBC. I don’t know where I’m going to live. We’ve got our apartment for three more weeks. If I don’t find a job in that time (which is very likely), then where am I going to live? How will I be able to afford San Francisco? Is my family going to be super upset if I decide to leave the Midwest? How often will I get to see them if I leave? How often will I get to see Grace? Is she going to be able to find a residency at a hospital in San Francisco when she graduates? Will I find people I like as much as the ones in San Francisco if I go work in some other city? How often will I get to see my high school and college friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions, folks. These are what have been keeping me up at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re largely useless questions. if I don’t find a place by the time we need to leave, I can find a couch to crash on. Or I can fly home. Grace has another year in school, so worrying about our plans for next year when she graduates won’t help anyone. I shouldn’t choose where I live based on my parents. They want me to be happy and to be the best I can. If I think that’s in San Francisco, then I should be here. Sure, they’ll be sad. I’ll be sad, too. But that’s not a reason to move back to the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the other questions are all unknowns. Worrying about them won’t help at all. Who the heck knows what’s going to happen whether I stay or go? All we can do is take it one day at a time and have a fun time in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team made an awesome project. We cut it pretty close, but we made a really cool website. The code is awesome. Well, it probably sucks, but right now I feel like it’s really cool. There’s some great stuff happening on the back end. And the front end turned out fantastic, too. It’d be awesome if you checked out the site: Bookmeetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t honestly know how it looks on all browsers. We didn’t do a whole lot of cross-browser compatibility testing, and I don’t believe that the site is at all responsive. I do know that it looks super cool on laptops and monitors on Chrome, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a rough project, but it was so much fun! It felt like an eternity, even though it started just a week ago. I’m exhausted, but I’m also amazed at the code that we were able to write in five days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we’re all just a ten-minute presentation away from graduating. And then who knows where we’ll go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s terrifying not to know. Terrifying and super exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tuesday, Week 9: Final Feature Freeze</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was our last day to add new features to our websites. Coming into this project, I thought that we would be able to add new features up until our presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope! We present on Friday morning, but we’re not allowed to add code either Wednesday or Thursday. And the reason’s pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were allowed to keep adding features, we would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right up until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we would get up to present, and something would break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teachers are saving us from adding features and having no time to fix them. After today, we cannot add features. After tomorrow,we can’t touch the code at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday is a day to take off from writing code. It’s a day to prepare presentations for the project. It’s a day to reflect on how the project went. It’s a day to sleep, since we haven’t been getting much. It’s a day to see our site and to decide which features we would most like to brag about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m ready for it to be over. I’m ready for sleep. The team has been working some fairly crazy hours, and we’ve been working harder in those hours than we have with our other projects. This final push is by no means sustainable, and I think it’s starting to show. Everyone’s been a bit more on edge, more irritable, and more slap-happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure at the very least we’ll all be taking a nap today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it’s just a sprint to get the project done and that it’s part of finishing Dev Bootcamp, but life has really fallen out of balance for this final project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extended lunch breaks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guilt-free naps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish! (Just kidding on the last one. Hopefully it won’t come to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just been a tough week. For about four days in a row, I’ve had a fairly constant low level of panic that we either won’t finish or that we won’t have a cool product to show off. It’s made us work harder, but it’s also made me have less patience. I’ve been on edge and feeling stressed, which is never the best way to feel. It’s way more fun to feel care-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to pick that back up tomorrow. Because at the end of the week, we’ll present our projects. We’ll be done. And in a week, we’ll think that all of our code is garbage anyway. So who cares!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we didn’t really add many features today. It was the last day to do so, but we focused on testing and styling for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our teachers told us, it’s better to have 3 features that are 100% tested and working than to have 10 features at 90% each. If it breaks at all during the presentation or in use, no one will use the site. If they’re only 95% finished, they might as well be 5% finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to continue adding features, to say wouldn’t it also be cool if… But we can’t! If we do, some stuff will hit the fan. We’ll have zero hours to fix and to test all ten of our features and to style the entire site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about striking a balance. And it’s not something that we would have done by ourselves, so it’s a good thing that the teachers put this feature freeze into place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monday, Week 9</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Guuuys, there’s so not enough time to work on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re making solid progress and getting a lot done with the website. Every time we talk about what we need to do next, though, the list just magically grows back to the length it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit exhausting. I’m having a blast, and I’m worried that we’re not going to make the magical website that I have in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to get close, but a lot of the features that I want would just involve more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teachers have been saying that we should focus on fewer features. We should have a couple of features that are 100% working instead of 10 features that are all at 80%. If a single feature breaks, no one is going to use our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s difficult to decide whether we should feature crush or stop and make all of our code work 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want a wow factor for our website. Right now, the website just kind of looks like something we could have made two weeks ago given enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last thing we do at Dev Bootcamp, so we want it to be something super crazy awesome. We want to set the bar higher than the Sea Lions did before us so that the Golden Bears will have a tough act to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, I’m feeling as though this final project really doesn’t matter all that much. Yes, it’s the final thing we make at Dev Bootcamp. But it’s still cruddy. Nothing that any team makes this week is going to be something that we still think is good in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we continue to learn and make new projects, we’ll be able to make better versions of our websites by ourselves in a fraction of the time. This isn’t the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project isn’t a judgment of who we are as people. We are not our code. So we just need to get working and make the best thing we can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Friday and Weekend, Week 8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sooooo we’ve been working on our final projects this weekend…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some victories, and we have a solid minimum viable product. HOWEVER, I can see a storm a-brewin’ on some features that we want to add. And we only have two more days to add features. Sooo toots.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thursday, Week 8: Final Projects Begin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we started our final projects. We’ve now begun the last thing that we’ll be doing at Dev Bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the biggest project we’ve worked on by far, and it’s extremely exciting/terrifying. We have a week to build something. That’s our instruction. No more daily challenges and very few lectures. It’s just four groups of five boots using everything that we’ve learned to build a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started off with pitches. Any boot who wanted to pitch an idea got the floor for one minute. We presented our pitches to all three of the cohorts and coaches, so it was maybe seventy people or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I pitched! What? Week 1 Matthew would not have done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even more surprising was how not terrified I felt when I was in front of the group. I kept my feet planted and didn’t sway (or, at least, I don’t think I did). I managed to make actual eye contact with some of the people in the audience, which I’ve always been a bit scared to do. I managed to look left and to look right. And I managed to deliver some jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt confident up there. I wasn’t scared that I was being graded or being judged. I wasn’t scared about what I was going to say. I just did the best I could to deliver a fun pitch about Bookmeetups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked! The projects were voted on by all of the boots, and mine was voted as one of the top four. I now have the opportunity to work on making Bookmeetups look more how I had envisioned it when I worked on it a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get to do it with an awesome team, too. I think that we’ll be able to make something that we can all be really proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Lead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also excited to be team lead. I know it’s going to be really hard for me. I don’t know what all needs to go into this project. I don’t know how to manage everyone’s time and effort. I have trouble with being assertive. I’m not great at telling people that we need to move on when they want to keep talking. I’m not good at disagreeing with people and standing my ground. Usually, I’ll just let the other person have their way and quietly seethe with anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, we’re all equals at DBC. We all just started eight weeks ago. No one has more power than anyone else. So it feels weird for me to be team lead and to be the one tell everyone that we need to move on or to have the final say on how we’ll implement a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be an interesting week. While coding, I’ll also be trying to become more assertive, making decisions about the direction of the project, and having some difficult conversations. It’s gonna be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s the only time that we’re actually growing, so I’m really looking forward to the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wednesday, Week 8: The Calm Before the Storm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today rocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was kinda way tired, but I didn’t feel stressed. After finishing this project, I shed all of this weight that I’d been carrying since last Thursday. I didn’t realize how shitty I was feeling until I was better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of like being sick. You don’t really know how sick you are while you’re sick. But when you get better and can breathe through your nose  and don’t have a throat that’s on fire or a stomach that’s in a constant state of unease, you realize just how crappy you were feeling before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m happy to have that all gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, today wasn’t too difficult. We had to complete a challenge that used strictly Javascript, jQuery and AJAX, and HTML/CSS. No ruby, no Rails. Just JavaScript. It’s a pretty awesome language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came into DBC, I was pretty convinced that I would be a Rails developer. I started to get defensive about Ruby and was dismissive of other languages. Oh, JavaScript’s lame because…uh..because it’s just stupid. Because I knew nothing about programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But JavaScript is a mighty powerful language. And the frameworks and libraries for the language are also awesome and only getting better. So I would definitely be okay getting a job that’s purely JavaScript now, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build Something Beautiful and Meaningful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shereef, the founder of DBC, gave a talk to us today, too, which is always awesome. The talk was about building beautiful, meaningful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a great position as software engineers. We’re able to talk to computers—inanimate friggin’ objects, guys—and make them do amazing things that can actually have a positive impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s important to remember that. Starting out, we’ll be bogged down in the specific building blocks. What’s a class? How should I write this method? What does this language do? How can this framework help me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the important stuff. Once we get good enough with the tools and languages, they’ll start to fade into the background. The specifics of how to write a method or how to structure the code to do x,y, and z will become second nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’ll free us up to think about the bigger things. What’s the ideal user flow? How can this be more efficient? How best do I use the space on the page? What problems can we solve with this? How can we make this app have a real impact on the world? How can we change the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just an awesomely inspiring talk. We can think of code as a construction site. We have all of these tools, and we use them to pour cement, lay bricks, and build walls. That’s all fine and dandy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But stuff like ^this^ doesn’t get built just by stacking bricks and pouring cement. That kind of building is on another level. That’s built by an architect, not a bricklayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s built by someone who sees Hogwarts instead of a construction site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wanna say that I’m Harry Potter, but what I’m learning with computers is the closest thing to magic that I can think of. And sure, right now I’m learning how to make spells that can do some pragmatic things—oculus reparo and wingardium leviosa—but sooner or later I’ll be ready to save the world. I’ll be able to cast charms to protect Hogwarts and to vanquish evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget that while I’m here at DBC, spending hours trying to get events to bind or trying to make my code more object-oriented. While we’re learning, we’re thinking about how the blocks all fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun, and it’s also necessary. But it isn’t the end goal. I don’t just want to know how to lay bricks. I want to make buildings that change the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what my Patronus will be…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tuesday, Week 8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I built Bookmeetups, I had to use some crazy little thing called jQuery to trigger something crazy called AJAX to make the number of stars you rated a book change both in my database as well as on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about two days to figure out how to make the clicking trigger with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I built a miniature version (like, super miniature) of jQuery in about five hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really hard. I’m not sure I understand a lot of what I did yet, but it’s crazy how much Dev Bootcamp has taught me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually crazy. It’s dumb how much I’m learning now. To go from zero to building a javascript library with the module pattern in eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s also so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND after I did that during the day, I worked on and—wait for it—finished (for now) my project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out: SF Bike Parking. If you’re not in San Francisco, it’s probably not going to work too well, as it only adds pins to San Francisco. You’ll have to move the map over to SF to find anything. And there’s a lot that it still can’t do, but there’s also a lot that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It talks to Google Maps and SF Data to figure out where the user is, where the closest bicycle parking is, and shows the user directions to get there. I didn’t know that you could do so much with the Google Maps API, so it was kind of awesome. And I’ve only scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m super relieved to have the project marked ‘complete,’ at least until I’m done with Dev Bootcamp. It was adding a lot of stress, and I’m happy that I’m only going to focus on Dev Bootcamp homework tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard. But the really cool thing is that I used a bunch of technology that I’d never used before, and I didn’t totally fail. I wrote in a different programming language (Python), used a JavaScript framework (Backbone) I’d never seen, and used two APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I learned how to do all of this in less than 9 weeks. What’s going to happen when I have a few years under my belt?&lt;/p&gt;
