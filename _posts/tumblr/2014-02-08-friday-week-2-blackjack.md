So, today was group project day. The assignment was pretty wide open. It was to build an application. The application could or be anything—something we’ve worked on before or something new.

My group (Brittany, Hunter, and I) decided to make Blackjack. We’ve been learning about object-oriented design and about databases recently, and making Blackjack would have allowed us to practice both.

Working with them as a group was awesome. They’re both wildly good at this coding thing, so it was great having them on the team. Hunter just knows logic like nobody’s business, and Brittany made the game look great. We ran into roadblocks, but we could always find a workaround. We told ourselves that we would be done by 8pm, and we were finished by 7:45!

I was scared going into today because I knew it was group project day. My experience with group projects has been pretty negative in the past. I’ve always felt like the one who cared the most or at all about the outcome of the project, so I always felt like I was doing most of the work. I was worried that I would end up doing most of the work for this project, as well. Or that I would work with someone who was obstinate and would always insist on something being done his or her way.

But in Dev Bootcamp, everyone wants to do the project. Everyone wants to succeed. Everyone wants the team to function and the project to go smoothly.

We always use our past experiences to judge whether we’ll enjoy some similar future experience. If you broke out in hives the last time you ate shellfish, you’ll probably avoid shellfish. If you burned your hand on the stove as a kid, you probably won’t touch the stove again when it’s on.

I hated group projects (with few exceptions) in the past, so I didn’t want to work on one today. But I was worried for nothing because I couldn’t have asked for a better team. Hunter, Brittany, and I nailed it.

Here’s a screenshot of our game in action.

I should probably get to bed, though. We’ve got a hackathon all day tomorrow!
