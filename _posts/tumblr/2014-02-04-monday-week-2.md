We need boundaries.

I need to set some stricter (more strict?) boundaries for myself here at Dev  Bootcamp. Something that I talked about with Sefora (the counselor at DBC) last Thursday was my constant feeling of not spending my time how I should be.

At Dev Bootcamp, my time falls under two main umbrellas: study and socialization. Studying might encompass reading, coding, writing, pairing, and the like. Socialization involves talking to people, whether about themselves, about code, about Dev Bootcamp, or whatever else.

A giant problem that I’ve been running into so far at Dev Bootcamp is when to study and when to socialize. I’ll usually start doing one, feel guilty that I’m not doing the other one, and then not being able to focus on the task at hand.

For example, when I was sitting and watching some videos as part of our day’s assignments earlier, I was aware that there were groups of people all around, talking and hanging out. I immediately wanted that for myself. Oh gosh, what cool things are they talking about? I wanna be included!

And so I stop focusing on the videos. I miss entire sentences and ideas and need to go back to re-watch them. I’m no longer paying attention to the videos because I can only focus on the feeling that I should be socializing. I don’t want to get through this program and feel that I didn’t make a bunch of lifelong friends. The people here are all so interesting, and I have so much to learn from them—I don’t want to miss out on that because I’m sitting by myself practicing and writing.

On the other hand, I also don’t want to get through this program feeling as though I didn’t learn as much as I could. So, when I’m chatting with people or going out to eat, I start to get a nagging feeling that I should be working instead. At which point, I start to lose focus on what people are saying, lose my ability to hold a conversation, and start to get a more closed-off body language that hints that I want to leave.

I’m having trouble being present in whatever I’m doing. I’m losing out on socialization and on study just by feeling like I should be doing the other one.

I don’t think I’m alone in this. We all sometimes have a voice in our head nagging at us, telling us that there’s something that we should be doing. Call the voice whatever you will—inner critic, superego—it’s causing us harm by telling us that we’re not doing the right thing.

Whatever activity you’re focused on, be it procrastination or something productive, it is far better to focus your attention entirely on that activity. Feeling guilty that you’re watching TV because you feel as though you should be doing work is going to take the joy out of watching TV. You might spend an hour watching a TV show but in no way feel recharged because you didn’t even enjoy it. So maybe then you decide to watch another episode to see if you enjoy that one more, feeling more and more guilty each passing minute until you decide to work but are so angry that work stole your break that you can’t focus on it and produce some steaming pile of garbage that you scrap completely.

We humans are pretty awful at multitasking. Your mind can literally only focus on one thing at a time. Yeah, we can switch foci extremely quickly, but it still takes time to make the switches back and forth. It’s far better for productivity and efficiency to single-task.

What I want to do, then, is set some strict boundaries on my focus. Set a schedule. We’ll see how it goes, but my current plan is not to think about coding at all when I’m out to lunch or dinner. Lunch is from 12:30 to 2. Whether I’m going to yoga, going out to lunch with some of the boots, or making lunch and sitting with the boots, I am not going to think about the mound of work that I have to do. Dinner has a looser timeline. It’s usually about the time that people feel like going to eat. But when I do go out, whether dinner takes half an hour, an hour or two hours, I am not allowed to think about my code. I want to be present. Engaging in conversation with my fellow boots.

HOWEVER, when it’s not lunch or dinner time (or during a few breaks that I’ll take to keep myself sane), I am going to be focused on work. Reading an article. Talking to someone about a programming topic. Playing around with a method in irb. Making some quick programs as practice. Watching a video. Listening to a podcast. Reading a textbook. Taking notes. Asking a coach or teacher about a programming concept. Gathering thoughts and reflecting. Writing. Whatever it is, if it’s a solo activity, then the headphones are going on, and I’m not going to pay attention to the laughter and jovial activities of the rest of the boots—I’ll be able to talk to them at lunch and dinner.

By setting a schedule and convincing myself that I am not allowed to stray as far from the task at hand, I think I can eliminate the feeling of should that I’ve been getting and can be more present overall. When I’m learning, I’ll learn more, and when I’m socializing, I’ll be more engaged and more engaging.
