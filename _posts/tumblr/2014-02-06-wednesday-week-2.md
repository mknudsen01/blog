More improvements have been made on the boundaries front. I’ve been trying to do some timeboxing for the past few days. I’ll set a time limit on how long I’ll spend on a particular activity with Egg Timer. Once the timer goes off, it’s time to move on to something else. If I don’t set time limits, I can just sort of get lost in the code.

Last Saturday, for example, I told myself that I was only going to work on our Sudoku challenge for an hour before moving on to reading. Four hours later, I realized that I’d gotten pretty much nowhere and was just ticked that I’d let so much time slip away. Johnny introduced me to the Egg Timer site, and Sherif has mentioned on multiple occasions the idea of timeboxing.

I’m aware that it’s not exactly a new idea to set time limits on activities. But it’s not something I’ve ever really implemented in my life. I’ve usually just focused on an activity until I either finished or couldn’t stand the thought of working on it for another minute.

So, this new technique has been pretty cool. My partner for the day (Irene and I used timeboxing for our challenges today, too. When you know you’ve got a time limit, I think it really allows you to cut out the less worthwhile activities.

There were probably 3+ hours of coding (for noobs) involved with one of the programs that we had to create today. But not all of the work would be  of equal importance. There’s the higher level design process—thinking about how all of the classes can be constructed and can interact with each other according to object-oriented programming principles. Then there’s the other stuff that’s mostly a matter of syntax. We could spend maybe ten or fifteen minutes researching the syntax for one minor feature for the program.

But it’s a syntax issue that we’ll probably need to look up multiple times in the future. We know where to find it and could learn how to implement it relatively easily. It wasn’t challenging. It was just busywork. It wasn’t the point of the exercise, so we could safely skip it.

When I was working on designing a (really simple) hospital with Darren yesterday, we spent about an hour and a half trying to figure out how to get some methods to work. Those methods weren’t really an integral part of the exercise, though. The main point was to design the high level classes of patients, employees and administrators of the hospital, taking inheritance and composition into account. The point wasn’t to figure out the exact syntax to add some small bit of functionality that we would have trouble duplicating today.

There’s not enough time for everything. We can’t do all of the parts of all of the challenges. Instead of focusing for hours on some of the minutiae of Ruby, our time would have been better spent learning about separation of concerns, single responsibility, and the law of Demeter. We could have been reading articles on the topics and discussing how we might make the general layout and control flow of our program more in line with the ideas.

In contrast, Irene and I had a much easier time creating a similar program today. We sketched out the design for ten minutes, talked about the features we would need for another ten minutes, and then set a timer for an hour to get a minimum viable product.

Knowing that we were kind of racing the clock, we were able to trim the fat. If a feature was causing issues, it usually wasn’t part of the primary intent of the assignment, so we made a decision to skip it and come back later if we had time. And we got our MVP up and running with fifteen minutes to spare. It was awesome.

Not to get all corny and YOLO-y on everyone (sorry for saying YOLO. (And for mentioning it again)), but I think this is something that we can transfer over into our lives, too. Whooooooaaaa, programming lesson turning into a life lesson, guys.

There’s not enough time for everything. We shouldn’t be robots who timebox every moment, but how often do we spend time just sitting and worrying about the minutiae of life?

It’s like 80% of my day! But it’s time wasted. It doesn’t serve us to worry about the trivial bits of our everyday lives. There are far bigger, better, more challenging, more exciting, more interesting, more fun things to be doing.

To be able to focus on and to appreciate those things, though, we’ve got to trim the fat.
