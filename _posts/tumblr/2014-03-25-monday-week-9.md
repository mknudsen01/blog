Guuuys, there’s so not enough time to work on this project.

We’re making solid progress and getting a lot done with the website. Every time we talk about what we need to do next, though, the list just magically grows back to the length it was before.

It’s a bit exhausting. I’m having a blast, and I’m worried that we’re not going to make the magical website that I have in my head.

We’re going to get close, but a lot of the features that I want would just involve more time.

Our teachers have been saying that we should focus on fewer features. We should have a couple of features that are 100% working instead of 10 features that are all at 80%. If a single feature breaks, no one is going to use our website.

So, it’s difficult to decide whether we should feature crush or stop and make all of our code work 100%.

We want a wow factor for our website. Right now, the website just kind of looks like something we could have made two weeks ago given enough time.

This is the last thing we do at Dev Bootcamp, so we want it to be something super crazy awesome. We want to set the bar higher than the Sea Lions did before us so that the Golden Bears will have a tough act to follow.

So, there’s that.

And at the same time, I’m feeling as though this final project really doesn’t matter all that much. Yes, it’s the final thing we make at Dev Bootcamp. But it’s still cruddy. Nothing that any team makes this week is going to be something that we still think is good in a couple of weeks.

If we continue to learn and make new projects, we’ll be able to make better versions of our websites by ourselves in a fraction of the time. This isn’t the end.

This project isn’t a judgment of who we are as people. We are not our code. So we just need to get working and make the best thing we can.
