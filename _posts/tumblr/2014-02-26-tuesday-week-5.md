Your two goals for the day are to get Javascript Racers 1 and 2 done. That’s it.

Two goals! For the whole day! That’s entirely reasonable, right? That’s a feasible workload. I figured each one would take a few hours, and I’d actually have some free time to play catch-up on some of the challenges. And get some sleep.

Buuuut thirteen hours later, I’m maybe halfway through the second challenge.



I’ve been having a rough go with this Javascript stuff.

It’s easy to write sloppy code, but it’s reeeeeaally not too easy for me to write sound, object-oriented, modularized, loosely-coupled code.

But in just a few weeks, I’ve grown up quite a bit as a programmer. I’m starting to think in terms of objects instead of procedural code. I’m not the best at it. I don’t always know how to implement it. I run into brick walls constantly. Sometimes I’m stuck spinning my wheels for an hour or so.

Then I “finish” the project or implement that one thing that was keeping me stuck, though, and it’s all worth it. Coding here at Dev Bootcamp is just a constant series of challenges that are just beyond my reach. And today, I felt pretty good about the confusion. I felt great exploring and failing with my pair for most of the day.

It took us a long time to finish the challenge, and it’s still not the greatest-looking piece of code. But it works. And it’s a lot better than our first attempt was. We learned a lot about what not to do, about what doesn’t work. And that’s only going to help us in the future. I learned ten or fifteen different little tricks, and by the end of the day, I was getting comfortable at defining JavaScript objects and writing jQuery events.

Back when I was trying to make my own website —Bookmeetups.com (I had no idea how to make websites at the time, so please be gentle.)—I looked around a lot for plug-ins that would help my website function. I was completely clueless as to how these code snippets worked, though.

For two reasons. First, I didn’t know what jQuery was. But second, because a lot of these things are poorly written. A lot of them are just garbage that don’t have method names and provide no context for their code. It’s possible to tease out what they do, but they could be a lot easier to understand.

BUT NOW. I have the ability to sort of understand them. It’s a very empowering realization. I thought that those bits of code were written by super-intelligent otherworldly beings who I could never hope to emulate. The code was written with English words, but it was in an unintelligible language. When I was writing a small bit of jQuery for my site to make the star ratings for books update asynchronously (probably the most technical thing that I did with my site), it took me days. I was just grasping at straws for hours, writing garbage code that didn’t work. I could probably write a better piece of code now within an hour or so.

So I am SUPER excited just to make a way better bookmeetups.com either while I’m here at DBC or after I graduate. It will be a lot of fun to see how much quicker and how much better I can make the website.

I love solving challenges, so it’s just awesome to be able to be solving problems and learning ALL DAY. I’m diving into these brand new concepts and languages, and I’m not completely floundering all day. Just for some of the day! And then I start to understand what’s going on and end up building something that I never really thought that I’d be able to build.

Tomorrow, we tackle AJAX.
