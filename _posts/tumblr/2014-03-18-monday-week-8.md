Irene and I paired today.

Today, we were focused on optimizing loading times. For one challenge, we were working with a giant database, which was making the load time gross. We added indexes to the databases and cached some values on one of the tables in order to make the page go from taking about four seconds to load to about 70 milliseconds.

It was hella cool.

For the other challenge, the site we were working with was loading everything in the database as well as all of the pictures that were stored in the database upon loading the page.

We were able to use AJAX calls to start the page loading next to nothing and only retrieving the relevant database info when a user clicked on a link. That made the page loading time drop from about 7 seconds to about 100 milliseconds.

Again, hella cool.

It’s always a lot of fun pairing with Irene. We keep the mood light while we’re working, and we seem to be able to make it through any roadblocks fairly quickly.

Which is good because we both have some personal projects that we’re working on. We were able to make it through the challenges that we wanted to get done by about 7, so we had the rest of the night to work on our own stuff.

I’m still working on the bicycle parking app. I made quite a bit of progress this evening. However, it seems as though the more I add, the more I can see where the site needs improvement. I finished my minimum viable product this evening, which is awesome!

I should be super stoked, right? I used a language I didn’t know, an API I didn’t know, and a framework that I didn’t know, yet I managed to put something together! It’s way cool!

But I can see what needs to be fixed. I can see what functionality I want to add. I can see the styling and effects that I want to implement.

And I can also see that I have very little time to implement all of these changes while finding the time to refactor the code and to test it. The final project pitches are on Thursday, so that doesn’t leave me a whole lot of hours to devote to this project in the evenings.

We’ll see where I’m at by Wednesday night.

Anyway, I really wanna be a coach.

Tyler and Salar were both in this evening. And they get paid to hang out with the boots and code with them.

It’s something that I would do for free (and I’m sure that they would, too). I would get to help boots all night, be it with code or with life. So this week and next week, I’m going to make a point to walk around for at least half an hour/an hour and help out some of the boots where I can.

Anyway, it’s kind of way late, so I should be getting to bed.
