Well, today had some highs and some lows.

Our challenge for the day was to create a Hacker News clone. A baby clone. It’s not going to have all of the features. But we were supposed to make something that would allow people to sign up and log in, submit and read stories, and read and post comments. It was also supposed to support the ability for users to vote up stories that they liked.

This week we’re learning JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery, which can be used to add some interactivity to websites. It makes the most sense to use the JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery to add some interactivity to the votes. A user can just click on an up arrow, and the vote number goes up by one without having to reload the entire page.

That’s the power of AJAX. Any time something on the website you’re on is updating itself without actually reloading the entire page, AJAX is being used. If you’ve ever gotten error messages (password is too short, etc) when signing up for a website, it’s using AJAX to validate your input and display the error messages. It’s used to create infinite scrolling on sites like Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter. AJAX checks to see if any new posts or tweets come in, and it will update your news or Twitter feed accordingly.

So, AJAX is pretty powerful. It can do some pretty sweet stuff. Right now, all we’re expected to do is make it update a number, but the fact that we can actually DO that without making the page refresh entirely makes our websites seem faster and more polished. It’s a small step towards being able to add some truly awesome functionality to our websites.

The frustrating part of today, then, was that you can’t get to the votes part until pretty much everything else is in place. All of the functionality of displaying and adding stories and comments, creating users, and checking their credentials when they log in needs to be in place before it’s possible to throw votes into the mix.

Getting all of that in place takes time. I spent most of the day getting the basic functionality of the site up and running—making tests, creating the database, setting up the routes, and getting it all to come together.

All I wanted to do all day was work on understanding JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery! But I couldn’t because of all the pre-work that had to happen. I was getting antsy for a lot of the day because I was excited to do other things. It was kind of like eating a dinner when I know that there’s a super delicious dessert coming. I just wanted to get the meal over with so that I could start eating my Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake.

While I was antsy about getting to work on the interactivity-adding part of the site, I also noticed that I actually knew what I was doing.

I knew how to make the tables in the database. I knew how to validate the information, both at the database level and the model level. I knew how to set up my RESTful routes. I knew how to write my tests. I knew how to do pretty much everything that was had to happen. Even when Quentin (my awesome pair for the afternoon) was driving, I knew pretty much what he was going to type before he typed it.

A week ago, everything about putting these websites online was a struggle. Now, even though it still takes some time, I know exactly what needs to happen. It was a pretty awesome realization.

We get frustrated here when we don’t understand something. The past couple of days, I’ve been getting frustrated that I don’t understand how to write abstract, object-oriented JavaScript. I’ve only been trying for a couple of days! People spend months and years getting really great at these languages. And here I am, pouting that I don’t have it down pat in twenty-four hours.

It’s silly. And after wading through all of this confusion for a week or two, I’ll be doing some amazing things. Exponentially faster than I would be able to do on my own. It’s crazy! Crazy awesome!

So while the day was frustrating in that I didn’t get to what I wanted to do very quickly, upon some reflection, it was a pretty huge win. I’m comfortable making basic apps with Sinatra. And in another week, I’ll probably be fairly comfortable using JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX to add some cool functionality to the sites that I’m making.
