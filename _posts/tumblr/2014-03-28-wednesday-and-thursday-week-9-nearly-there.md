So, there’s a very real chance that this has been the hardest that I’ve ever worked during a five-day stretch. The work hours haven’t been a whole lot worse than they have been for the rest of DBC, but I haven’t been able to sleep much.

I’ve been anxious. About all of the things. I’ve been anxious about the final project. I want it to be something that I’m extremely proud to show off. Everyone in the team (and everyone in the other teams, I’m sure) has been running on fumes for the past few days. We’re pumping out code, but it’s not as quickly or with the same quality as when we’re at 100%. Everything took a little bit longer, naps and breaks became more frequent, and coffee was relied on pretty heavily.

I’ve been anxious about the presentations. Even though they’re only ten-minute presentations—during which I’ll talk for a maximum of three minutes—I’m very uneasy about giving them. I’ve never been excited to give a presentation. I always worry that I’ll freeze up or say something stupid. There’s not as much pressure now—even if we completely melt down,  we’ll still graduate and will be ready to get jobs—but I still want to put out the best work that I can. Typically, the worrying and stressing about presentations helps me. I’ll rehearse and really think through what I want to say, so they usually go pretty well. Still, though, it’s not awesome to feel anxious.

And I’ve been anxious about life after DBC. I don’t know where I’m going to live. We’ve got our apartment for three more weeks. If I don’t find a job in that time (which is very likely), then where am I going to live? How will I be able to afford San Francisco? Is my family going to be super upset if I decide to leave the Midwest? How often will I get to see them if I leave? How often will I get to see Grace? Is she going to be able to find a residency at a hospital in San Francisco when she graduates? Will I find people I like as much as the ones in San Francisco if I go work in some other city? How often will I get to see my high school and college friends?

These are the questions, folks. These are what have been keeping me up at night.

And they’re largely useless questions. if I don’t find a place by the time we need to leave, I can find a couch to crash on. Or I can fly home. Grace has another year in school, so worrying about our plans for next year when she graduates won’t help anyone. I shouldn’t choose where I live based on my parents. They want me to be happy and to be the best I can. If I think that’s in San Francisco, then I should be here. Sure, they’ll be sad. I’ll be sad, too. But that’s not a reason to move back to the Midwest.

And the other questions are all unknowns. Worrying about them won’t help at all. Who the heck knows what’s going to happen whether I stay or go? All we can do is take it one day at a time and have a fun time in the process.

The team made an awesome project. We cut it pretty close, but we made a really cool website. The code is awesome. Well, it probably sucks, but right now I feel like it’s really cool. There’s some great stuff happening on the back end. And the front end turned out fantastic, too. It’d be awesome if you checked out the site: Bookmeetups.

I don’t honestly know how it looks on all browsers. We didn’t do a whole lot of cross-browser compatibility testing, and I don’t believe that the site is at all responsive. I do know that it looks super cool on laptops and monitors on Chrome, though.

It was a rough project, but it was so much fun! It felt like an eternity, even though it started just a week ago. I’m exhausted, but I’m also amazed at the code that we were able to write in five days.

And now we’re all just a ten-minute presentation away from graduating. And then who knows where we’ll go from there.

It’s terrifying not to know. Terrifying and super exciting.
