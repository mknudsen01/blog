I went to a meetup at Mozilla the other day. I had a lot of trouble finding the event because Mozilla has a couple of different offices in the building that they’re in.

I eventually found a Mozilla employee and told him that I was looking for an event there. He asked me if I meant some other event. I can’t remember the name, so let’s call if CoolFunTime. So he asked if I meant CoolFunTime. I didn’t, but I said “yeah, maybe” and followed him through the maze of offices on that side of the building.

We had a really awkward conversation along the way. It was pretty much:

"So, do you work at Mozilla?"

"Yep."

another minute of silence and walking

After that thrillfest, we made it to the door leading to the event. He used his keycard to open the door, and I walked into a party thing—music, food, drinks, and mostly attractive people on the patio of the office looking out over the Easy Bay. It felt like cool kid corner.

There’s virtually zero chance that this is the meetup, I thought to myself. These meetups, especially this HTML5 game one that I was going to, are typically not super well-attended events. And for the smaller ones like this one, there’s certainly not typically music, drinks, or food.  I told the guy that this was not the event that I was looking for.

I checked my phone for more details and told him that I was looking for the “Foxhole.” He seemed to know what that meant, so we went to the clear other side of the building.

He opened the door, and I was met with a gray, drab room with about thirty shitty chairs and three people. Bingo! The striking difference between the events made me start giggling to myself like a weirdo.

The meetup was pretty cool. The topic of HTML5 games was cool, and it was really neat to see some of the games that can now be played in your browser. That’s in the friggin’ BROWSER, guys.  It’s amazing how advanced it’s all getting.

The difference in the two events, though—it me to thinking about why I’m doing this coding thing. Obviously, programmers are in high demand, especially here in San Francisco. If you can code really well, you’re golden. These people can work their magic and make some really cool stuff that will make some companies a lot of money.

So, they’re pampered. They’re making a lot of money. They work in cool offices that might overlook the Bay or be in the heart of downtown San Francisco. And they get events thrown for them, like the CoolFunTime event I accidentally walked into.

New Relic throws some similar events. Last week, we had a 50’s-themed happy hour with food, music and drinks. And I’m sure a lot of the companies in the area throw similar events.

It was fun, but that’s not why I want to be programming. And it’s important to remember that that’s not why I want to be programming. It’s cool to be pampered and appreciated, and the people at CoolFunTime were enjoying being pampered after a week of work at Mozilla. But it’s also probably pretty easy to get into a stasis if I get really excited about the pampering—putting in the eight hours of work and then going off to do other things that don’t involve code.

But the people in the not-super-well-lit, drab Foxhole are the ones who are really hustling. Most of them have day jobs, and then they’re spending a good chunk of their Friday night going to a small event because they love making games, want to get better at it, and want to talk to other people like them. It’s awesome, and it’s inspiring.

These are the kind of people I want to surround myself with. With whom I want to surround myself—sorry. The people who want to spend their nights coding. The people who want to build things, to hone their craft, and to make the things that they’ve always wanted to see or to use or to play. They’re the ones who will get really good at coding, and they’re the ones who will push me to become a better coder.

They’re doing it for the love. The love that they get from learning and from writing cool programs. Not the love that they get from the bottom of a bottle. (Yeah? Smile Empty Soul, right, guys? Right? And it kind of comes into play with the love of the pampering with the parties and the drinks? I thought it was pretty good.)
