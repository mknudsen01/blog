Just a day, just an ordinary day. Just trying to get by.

Today was pretty cool! We solved the problem that we were having yesterday. Yesterday, we couldn’t get Redis and Sidekiq to run background jobs to send our tweets, but we got it working today. So that was a win.

The rest of the day, though. This burnout is really catching up with the cohort. There were only a handful of people still at DBC by the time 10PM rolled around.

I think everyone is just ready for this weekend. We’ll be between phases, and so there won’t technically be any assignments. I think quite a few of us will just be taking most of the weekend off. I’ll be getting to see a buddy from college who works out here now as well as my aunt and grandpa. It also sounds like I might be going rock climbing with a few of the coaches from DBC, so it should be a good time.

Tomorrow’s the last day of Phase 2. That means we have a graduation! The phase ahead of us—the Sea Lions—will be presenting their final projects tomorrow morning. I’ve seen glimpses of their projects, and they’re really cool. I’ll post more on what they were like later this weekend.

After we see their presentations, we’ll be working on refactoring our Survey Gorilla projects from last weekend. We’re going to pick out a piece of ugly code, refactor it, and test it.

Johnny and I are hoping to make it through that quickly so that we can work on another project. Salar, one of the coaches, came in tonight and started a project with us.

He says that everyone in our phase is kind of rocking it. We’re far beyond where his cohort was at when he was in Phase 2. We’re pushing good code, and things are great.

But we’re not building enough on our own. We’ve got some time, and we should be using it to build some pet projects. Just stupid little things to show off a particular skill that we’ve acquired over the past few weeks or to explore a new library or program.

By making these projects, we’re building our skills and operating without any directions. We won’t have any instructions on how to make the projects that we just thought up. We need to decide where we want to go as well as figure out how to get there. Those are important skills to build.

When we start looking for jobs, we’ll want to have a portfolio that shows off our work. If we’re not making anything in our free time, then we really won’t have anything to show that sets us apart.

Plus, working on passion projects is more fun than working on something that we’re told to do. It’s all personal. We came up with the idea, so we want to see it through to completion. We might cut fewer corners and really spend time on the details to ensure that our code is tested, functioning, and refactored.

So, we started working on something with three.js, which is a JavaScript library that allows you to make 3D scenes with JavaScript. The examples on that link are just really impressive. Based on where your cursor is, you change the angle of the “camera” and can interact with the scene.

Salar, Johnny, Brittany, Irene and I made a little bit of progress last night. We decided that we just want to create an 8-bit Mario who will jump up, hit a block, and come down. Though it sounds pretty trivial, there’s a lot going on. We’ll need to render Mario block by block, to create “gravity,” to figure out how to make him jump, and to figure out how to make all of the blocks move in unison, all while working with a complex library that we didn’t know existed until a few hours ago.

It’s going to be a lot of fun.

Hopefully, we’ll all make some decent progress on the project tomorrow. Once six rolls around, we’re off to a bar to help Phase 3 celebrate their graduation. After the tough three weeks, I think it’ll be great for everyone to relax and blow off some steam.
