We recently had a “fireside chat” with Shereef, the founder of Dev Bootcamp. This fireside chat was brought into the 21st century—we were all watching Shereef on a video conference on our laptops instead of listening to FDR on the radio—but it had essentially the same function as Roosevelt’s fireside chats. Shereef wanted to connect with us “boots,” to answer our questions, to quell any rumors about the program and Ruby on Rails, and to tell us a little bit more about what we’re getting into at Dev Bootcamp.

Shereef had some friggin’ great analogies and advice—and I may type up some thoughts on some more of them—but my favorite had to be the kitchen versus the restaurant mindset at Dev Bootcamp. 

There are two ways to look at Dev Bootcamp (or any program, seminar, college that we might be attending). The first way is what Shereef called the “restaurant mindset.” My fellow boots and I paid a lot of money to come to Dev Bootcamp—over $12,000 for tuition alone—and so we may begin to feel entitled to success. “I spent $12,000, so they’d better get me a job.” It’s the same way with college or with anything that might involve spending money, like going to a fancy restaurant. 

We’re going to spend a lot of money at the restaurant, so we expect everything to be done and perfect for us. We should have multiple restaurant staff doting on me. May I take your hat, sir? Oh, miss, might I get you some more wine? Care for a foot rub while you eat, madam? 

We’re giving them our money! It’s their job to make sure that we enjoy ourselves. We’re paying for the food to be excellent, the waitstaff attentive, and the ambience damn convivial. If everything is not exactly how we want it to be, then we have the right to be pissed off about it. We spent hard-earned money expecting something, and the experience fell short. 

With this restaurant mindset, I would be going into Dev Bootcamp expecting them to do the camp for me, believing that the teachers there are supposed to instill a wide expanse of programming knowledge in me, to ensure that I’m making friends and building cool projects, and to find me an awesome job come the end of the nine weeks. I put in my money, and the rest is up to them. 

It’s easy to get caught up in this mindset. I certainly would like to know that I’ll get a job out of this camp. I certainly want to know that the people I meet and that the experiences I have will be worth it. 

But there is no guarantee. As Shereef said multiple times, even though Dev Bootcamp has been around for a couple of years now and is getting damn good at preparing us to be junior developers, it is still very much an experiment. There’s zero certainty, and that can be rather terrifying. By embracing the uncertainty, however, it is possible to approach Dev Bootcamp with the other attitude: the kitchen mindset. 

Where someone in a restaurant mindset expects to go and to have the experience brought upon him or her, someone in the kitchen mindset wants to make the experience for himself or herself. Rather than sitting at a table expecting everything to come to us, we can go back into the kitchen and make something awesome with the chef. 

In the kitchen mindset, we know that it’s up to us to make the great time for ourselves. To get the best meal, we go back into the kitchen and experiment. Yeah, we’ll get out hands and clothes dirty. Yeah, we’ll probably make some truly terrible-testing foods. BUT. We’ll also know that anything we eat is something that we made. Not only that, by getting deep in the trenches (kitchen trenches?) with the chef, we learn that we can actually cook some pretty good food. It may take some time and tinkering, but we know that we have the ability to make more foods on our own.  

We spent a lot of money to come to this restaurant, so we’re going to make it the best money we’ve ever spent. We’ll be damned if we let the restaurant hog all of the experience-making for us. 

I can go into Dev Bootcamp either feeling entitled or feeling ready to get my hands dirty. By feeling entitled, I look to the camp to do everything for me. By getting my hands dirty, I make the experience my own. If something isn’t great for me, I change it. If I’m upset, I let someone know so that we can fix it together. I’ll work with a certain gem or method in the way a chef might try an ingredient with a bunch of other foods. Chef will taste some awful experiments while testing where an ingredient fits best, but he will learn about the ingredient—where it works, where it doesn’t, and maybe even some unexpected pairings that haven’t been really been done before. That’s real learning.

A restaurant patron just orders some food, sees if they like it or don’t, and then leave. They know nothing of what ingredients are in there, why the chef decided to make the dish that specific way, or how the dish was prepared—just that they like the taste or don’t.

As Shereef tells us, those who go into Dev Bootcamp with the kitchen mindset are the ones who learn the most, have the most fun, and usually get the best jobs. They don’t get the great jobs because that’s what they’re working for. Rather, they’re working towards having the best time that they can, which involves being more open, experimenting, pairing with fellow boots, talking to the teachers, building projects, and asking questions. They are 100% committed to having a great time and squeezing every last experience out of Dev Bootcamp, and that is what leads to more learning.

Shereef urges us not even to think about finding a job until the 9 weeks are over. If we take the job out of the equation, then we’re just at a development camp for nine weeks. If there is no outcome we’re working towards, then the only thing that we’re focused on is the experience. The money’s all already spent and we’re definitely going to the camp, so we might as well make sure we have the best time of our lives! To do that, we can’t simply go to a restaurant; we’ve got to get back in the kitchen with the chef.
