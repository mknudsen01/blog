Whooaaaa I didn’t get any work done today!

That whole boundary thing that I was talking about yesterday? It didn’t go too well. But I erred on the side of too much socialization, which really hasn’t been a thing for me ever.

I didn’t hit my goal. BUT I also didn’t repeat the same behavior that’s been known to make me feel shitty—just sitting at a desk with my headphones on, beating myself up about how little work I’m doing.

In test-driven development, the first step is to write out a test for the code you’ve not yet written—a goal for your code. You create a test that might be something like apple.eat == “You took a bite of an apple” or whatever.

Then you run the code.

And then you see it fail.

Once you written out your intentions for the code, you can begin to write the code. You write your classes and methods and assign your variables, and then you test the code again.

When you test it again, the important thing isn’t necessarily to pass all of your tests. It’s to get the tests to spit out something different. It might spit out that the test is running perfectly. More likely, though, you’ll get a different error. You didn’t fix the code in one fell swoop, but you fixed part of it. You got one step closer to your goal.

That’s how coders code (maybe not all of them, but that’s the process that’s being stressed here at DBC). You can’t just have some vague ideas in your head regarding the code’s functionality, build all the code, and cross your fingers and pray that it works. If you do, you’ll get a bunch of errors and have no idea how to untangle them.

For most of my goals in recent memory, I’ve been wanting to do everything all at once. Like the coder who codes everything without running a single test, I just assume that I can accomplish my goals in one try. Then, when we inevitably fail, we’re left with a frustrated, tangled mess, and we don’t even want to deal with the original code or goal anymore.

I think a lot of us put a great deal of pressure on ourselves to get a goal accomplished as soon as I make it. Then when we fail, we just fall into a deep state of dejection. Baaaghh I always fail. I can’t do this. I don’t know why I ever thought I could.

Instead of that horrible self-defeating path, we could be working in the test-driven development mindset. To do that, we could come up with little goals. Then, when we likely fail, it’s not a failure. It’s well, I fixed part of the problem. I didn’t get the same error as before. I got one step closer.

With the test-driven mindset, the important thing is to get a different result from before the change, not necessarily to get the right answer.

I’m not going to view my whole holy crap I really didn’t get a whole lot of work done today as a failure. I didn’t fail. I set a goal last night, and even though I didn’t exactly hit my goal of setting strict boundaries for myself, I did get a different result.

From here, I’ll make adjustments and try to get hit the same goal in the coming days, but I now realize it’s supposed to take some trial and error. I’ll work too much some days and talk too much other days before I can strike a happy balance.

And that’s not a problem! It normally would be for me, but it’s not really bothering me right now. For so long, I’ve had a laser focus on the goal and never really on the process to achieving that goal. It’s always been about results, but then I lose out on the entire journey.

Then what? I get to my goal, don’t remember or appreciate how I got there, and set a higher goal for myself. Rinse and repeat.

It can’t be a rush to the results anymore. It’s time to slow down a bit, to see and appreciate the little victories and the little changes in behavior which, over time, WILL lead to the goals.
