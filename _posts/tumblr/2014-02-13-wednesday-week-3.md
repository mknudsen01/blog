So, we had our Phase 1 “assessments” today. I was pretty nervous going in.

Every three weeks, we have a one-on-one with a coach and go over some of the concepts that we learned about in the previous weeks of the phase. They’ll ask questions to gauge our understanding and have us write some code.

The assessments last for half an hour, and I was scared that I would be rushing to make some huge piece of complicated code. Make a sudoku solver in half an hour. Write out the heap sorting algorithm.

The coach who led me through the assessment was Strand. He’s also going to be one of my teachers for Phase 2 (spoiler alert: I’m moving on to Phase 2!).

I kept expecting the test to be just like the tests to which I’m accustomed. Closed notes and closed book. Lots of pressure. Obscure questions pertaining to some boring, useless minutiae of the material because the teacher wants to stump us. And a grade at the end.

I don’t know why I assumed that Dev Bootcamp would test in a similar way. DBC is flying in the face of the typical style of teaching. It’s a program that truly pushes us. It’s a program that tells us what we’re making and then teaches us the pertinent concepts. It’s a program that only hires and lets in those people who really get excited about programming and learning. It’s this wonderful incubator that aims to take us from fledgling programmers to world-class junior developers in just nine weeks. The teachers love what they’re teaching. The boots love what they’re learning. They wade through confusion and frustration for the feeling of accomplishment that comes from solving a challenge. For the love of solving the puzzle. For the love of learning. For the love of having something new just click.

Yet I thought for some reason that they would just test us in the way a normal school might. Have us type out from memory some algorithm or rattle off a dictionary definition or write out the exact syntax of a specific Ruby method.

That would certainly be the easy way to test us. They could just ask us objective questions, see how many we get right, and make their recommendation on whether we should move on or repeat Phase 1 based on our scores.

But that’s not the Dev Bootcamp way. Instead, they had us talk through some of the main concepts that we’ve been learning about. They had us make a simple data structure and then manipulate some of the data in it. Then they had us make it a little more complex—add a few more attributes and make it into a program with classes. Then they had us talk about how we might implement it in a database.

These were all central themes of most of the challenges that we’ve completed, ideas and topics that we’ve discussed and practiced over and over again. They weren’t trying to trip us up. They weren’t secret hoping that we’d fail. They didn’t throw in some obscure questions on something that was only mentioned once in our three weeks.

And a really crazy thing happened when I struggled a bit with one of the questions Strand asked me. He saw that I was struggling with the syntax, and so he told me that I could look it up.

Whaaaaat?! I can use notes and the Internet to find the answers to my problems?

Strand had to remind me of this a couple of times when I didn’t have some of the syntax committed to memory. It was crazy.

School testing teaches us not to cheat. Everything that we come up with on a test has to come from our mind and our mind alone. Using notes is cheating. Using the Internet is cheating. And cheating like that is wrong.

But Strand and I were talking about it after the assessment. That form of testing is just complete bologna. In the real world, cheating like that is one of the best ways to get work done. Looking on Stack Overflow or Googling a problem is some the best way to find the resources that will help us solve our problems. There are books, articles, tutorials, blog posts, podcasts, questions answered, solutions posted, and websites all dedicated to helping people who are struggling with coding issues. And it’s ridiculous not to use those resources when we’re writing code and answering questions.

The testing, like all of what DBC does, challenges traditional education in the best possible way. I didn’t feel scared once the “assessment” started—I was just talking about code with Strand, and it was awesome.
