Whaaaaaat?!? Week one is done!

I can’t believe how quickly it passed. The days were all long, but I was actually enjoying myself. I averaged getting in at about 8:30 and leaving at about 11. Them’s some 14+ hour days. I don’t think I’ve ever worked on anything for 14 hours a day for more than one day without hating it.

There’s just something intoxicating about the learning environment that Dev Bootcamp has put together. There’s such a buttload to learn about—at any one time there are probably ten things I can come up with off of the top of my head that I want to read/study/practice.

The crazy thing is that ALL OF THE THINGS sound interesting, and studying any of ALL OF THE THINGS would be time well spent, as they’ll give me more knowledge/exposure/practice as a developer.

Today, we coded pretty much all day. But before we hopped into that, Dev Bootcamp can’t let us just become little code monkeys. They want to remind us that we’re all people, so we did Friday check-ins.

We get into small groups, and everyone gets two uninterrupted minutes to share with the group what’s going on in their lives. The boots might share some happy moments, some attacks that they’ve suffered from their inner voices, some of their feelings of inadequacy, some bout that they’ve been having with their parents or significant others, or some thing that Dev Bootcamp did that they found annoying.

Since I kept my head down for the most part in school, I feel like I missed out on a lot of fun times. I was always afraid of breaking rules, so I lived a pretty tame life in grade school, high school, and college. Now that I realize that I’ve missed out on so much, I never want to miss out on anything again. I want to hear all the jokes, meet all the people, attend all of the social gatherings, and talk about all of the things.

That’s made it hard to focus at Dev Bootcamp a lot of the time. We’ve got some reading hours and time before nine and after six just to work by ourselves. DBC wants us to pair during the day, but outside those times, we can be alone and try to read and work. I just can’t let myself sit and read, though. If there are people a few feet from me getting to know each other better or having a fun conversation, I want to be a part of it. When I try to go back to reading, the voice inside my head just starts telling me that I should really go join that conversation.

Tomorrow and next week, I’m going to make it a goal at least to work by myself for an hour at DBC every day. Even with all of the hustle and bustle going on around me, I want to stick my headphones on and focus on reading a Ruby book for at least an hour.

After the check-ins, we had our assignment for the day: Sudoku. If you’re not familiar with sudoku, check out this site that explains the rules.

Basically, every row, every column, and every region needs to have the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.

So, for our assignment, we first needed to make a program that would solve EASY sudoku puzzles—puzzles that did not require guessing. We would receive a string of 81 numbers, like “619030040270061008000047621486302079000014580031009060005720806320106057160400030” and then change all of the zeroes to the correct numbers.

My partner (Erin) and I needed to figure out a way to represent all of the positions of the numbers, iterate through all of the zeroes, check the square’s row, column and region, change the number if there was only one possibility, and to restart the entire process if we made it to the end without having found all of the numbers.

AND. We did figure it out. It took quite a few hours, but it was just awesome that we had one goal for the day. After we solved the easy mode, we were supposed to move on to hard mode, making a program that could handle puzzles where the computer had to guess.

That turns out to be way harder. We need to find a way to make a guess but also be able to change the guess if we find out that it’s wrong. We spent a couple of hours trying to figure out how to do that but ultimately gave up. It’s going to have to happen this weekend!

There’s a lot to be doing this weekend—I’ve got a list of about fifteen things, each of which will take hours—so I should probably go get started.
