Phase 1 is nearly done! To finish out the phase, we’re working on a two-day group project. Anne, Darren, Harry and I are working on making a command line app that will display cocktails. Users will be able to search either by cocktail name or cocktail ingredient.

We’re doing something that I didn’t really know was possible before I came to Dev Bootcamp: scraping. You can tell your computer to go to a webpage and save all of its content into an object, and from there you can find the data that you want from the website.

We’re scraping MixDrinkipedia (which is maybe the worst name ever for a website). Anyway, each link on the main page links to a different page for each cocktail. We’re writing some code that will capture all of the data and pick out the category, ingredients, tasting notes, glassware, and instructions for the cocktail in one fell swoop (though it will be a fell swoop that takes a few minutes to run) and will add it all to our database.

The team’s been great so far, and I’m excited to see what we can get done tomorrow.

In other news, I had an appointment today with Sefora, the Dev Bootcamp counselor today. She comes in on Thursdays, and any student can have a half-hour session with her for free, which is awesome.

Today I wanted to talk with her about my social anxiety. Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve noticed that I feel afraid to speak up when I’m eating lunch in the kitchen with a bunch of the boots. They’re all people who I’ve talked to before. They’re all people who I like and who I would feel comfortable having a conversation with.

But something about it being a group makes me freeze up. The group will talk about topics that I want to talk about, yet I find myself just sitting quietly and feeling anxious, afraid to say what I want to say. It really puts a damper on the entire day, so I’d like to get over feeling that way.

We talked it out, and I think my ultimate problem is that I don’t want to waste the group’s time.

Which is bad for two reasons.

One. It’s pretty awful that I think I’m wasting other people’s time by saying something that I find interesting. Not only awful but also wrong. People could be talking about how they watched paint dry on the wall yesterday and still make it interesting if they speak about the topic with interest.

Two. It’s shitty that I care whether I’m wasting someone’s time. People waste my time with boring conversations all the time, and I still like them! If I waste a few minutes or say something stupid, they’re not going to hold it against me. They likely will forget about it before the day is over, and life will go on.

So, Sefora and I tried to figure out why I might have that thought about speaking in groups. I don’t think it stems from any one event, so I don’t think we really pinned it down.

She had me do a couple of exercises after that. The first one was just to say out loud that it’s okay to waste people’s time five times. Because it is okay. It’s super okay to say stupid things or to tell a joke that falls flat or to act silly or to tell a boring story. You can’t build a connection with someone by not saying anything.

I want to feel invited to speak my mind. I typically want someone to ask me a question directly or to ask me my opinion. That way, I have the green light to say what I want to say—they are interested in my opinion, so they won’t feel as though my answer wastes their time.

But people don’t do that often. Rarely in an informal conversation like those with the eight or ten people at the lunch table does the conversation travel in a circle so that everyone may have his or her say. And by “rarely,” I mean “never.”

Sefora told me to pretend that I had someone right next to me elbowing me or encouraging me that I should talk about what I’m thinking. It seemed a bit silly. But it’s also a bit silly to be 22 and afraid to speak my mind freely, so I went along with it.

So, I guess I now have an imaginary friend named Rick (Grace was talking to me about Walking Dead before DBC today) who snaps me out of my anxiety and tells me to speak up.

I’m gonna give it a try over the next few days to see if it will help me out. And if not, then I can just send Rick to Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends (anyone? No?).

But it’s worth a try. This anxious kid is so far from who I see myself as, so this anxiety makes me feel like some other, worse version of Matthew. I’m eager to send him on his merry way.
