Today rocked.

I was kinda way tired, but I didn’t feel stressed. After finishing this project, I shed all of this weight that I’d been carrying since last Thursday. I didn’t realize how shitty I was feeling until I was better.

It’s kind of like being sick. You don’t really know how sick you are while you’re sick. But when you get better and can breathe through your nose  and don’t have a throat that’s on fire or a stomach that’s in a constant state of unease, you realize just how crappy you were feeling before.

So, I’m happy to have that all gone.

Even better, today wasn’t too difficult. We had to complete a challenge that used strictly Javascript, jQuery and AJAX, and HTML/CSS. No ruby, no Rails. Just JavaScript. It’s a pretty awesome language.

When I came into DBC, I was pretty convinced that I would be a Rails developer. I started to get defensive about Ruby and was dismissive of other languages. Oh, JavaScript’s lame because…uh..because it’s just stupid. Because I knew nothing about programming.

But JavaScript is a mighty powerful language. And the frameworks and libraries for the language are also awesome and only getting better. So I would definitely be okay getting a job that’s purely JavaScript now, as well.

Build Something Beautiful and Meaningful

Shereef, the founder of DBC, gave a talk to us today, too, which is always awesome. The talk was about building beautiful, meaningful things.

We’re in a great position as software engineers. We’re able to talk to computers—inanimate friggin’ objects, guys—and make them do amazing things that can actually have a positive impact on the world.

And it’s important to remember that. Starting out, we’ll be bogged down in the specific building blocks. What’s a class? How should I write this method? What does this language do? How can this framework help me?

But that’s not the important stuff. Once we get good enough with the tools and languages, they’ll start to fade into the background. The specifics of how to write a method or how to structure the code to do x,y, and z will become second nature.

And that’ll free us up to think about the bigger things. What’s the ideal user flow? How can this be more efficient? How best do I use the space on the page? What problems can we solve with this? How can we make this app have a real impact on the world? How can we change the world?

It was just an awesomely inspiring talk. We can think of code as a construction site. We have all of these tools, and we use them to pour cement, lay bricks, and build walls. That’s all fine and dandy.



But stuff like ^this^ doesn’t get built just by stacking bricks and pouring cement. That kind of building is on another level. That’s built by an architect, not a bricklayer.

That’s built by someone who sees Hogwarts instead of a construction site.



I don’t wanna say that I’m Harry Potter, but what I’m learning with computers is the closest thing to magic that I can think of. And sure, right now I’m learning how to make spells that can do some pragmatic things—oculus reparo and wingardium leviosa—but sooner or later I’ll be ready to save the world. I’ll be able to cast charms to protect Hogwarts and to vanquish evil.

It’s easy to forget that while I’m here at DBC, spending hours trying to get events to bind or trying to make my code more object-oriented. While we’re learning, we’re thinking about how the blocks all fit together.

It’s fun, and it’s also necessary. But it isn’t the end goal. I don’t just want to know how to lay bricks. I want to make buildings that change the game.

I wonder what my Patronus will be…
