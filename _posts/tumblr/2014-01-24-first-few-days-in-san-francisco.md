The first few days in San Francisco have been great. It’s been nothing but sun and 60-degree weather.

Tuesday

The first day here was mostly working on getting myself acclimated to my apartment and the block I live on. We’re trying to fit a lot of guys into the apartment, so I was worried about how cramped it was going to be. But it’s huge! The site that had pictures of the apartment didn’t really capture how big the place was—it looked like it was a small living room and dining room, three small bedrooms, and two small bathrooms.

But it’s not! Very roomy, and I’m sure that we can fit all of the guys in. The only issue will be bathrooms—splitting two bathrooms between a bunch of guys could be trouble. I won’t be able to say I’ve never lived on the edge anymore once we all move out in April.











So, after staking my claim in one of the rooms and unpacking, it was time to get dinner. Stephen and Ivan were already here in San Francisco by the time I’d arrived, so we all went out to look for some dinner. We found a really great hole in the wall that had Vietnamese food. The place was called Cordon Bleu, and I was a spooked, as I’ve never tried Vietnamese food. It was a small menu that had mostly meat and rice, so I ordered a pork kebab (which was just some grilled pork and in no way a kebab), an imperial roll (just looked like a giant egg roll with mystery meats and vegetables), some rice with meat sauce, and country salad (read: shredded cabbage). It was all delicious. The price was right, too, so my guess is that we’ll be going back there at least a few times.

Wednesday

Wednesday was devoted to some esplorin’. Ivan was dropping his car off at a relative’s house because storing a car here in San Francisco is something like $300 per month at cheapest. Plus, I saw that gas was $3.75 per gallon, soooo a car was understandably not really possible. As such, he was gonna be gone most of the day dropping the car off and taking the train back.

So, Stephen and I did some walking. The night before, he’d told me that he’d heard this place called Wing Wings had the best wings in San Francisco, and so we wanted to go there for lunch. Wing Wings was on Haight Street. Matthew should have looked at the map to see where Haight Street was on a map before leaving. I thought it was just going to be a couple of blocks, and I was sorely mistaken.

2.2 miles (according to Google Maps) later, we found Wing Wings. And wouldn’t you know it, the door was locked when I went to open it. Turns out, Wing Wings didn’t open for another couple of hours.

Whoops.

I was wearing boots that I’ve discovered aren’t meant for walking—especially up and down the many hills of San Francisco—and the only thing keeping me happy was the thought of some fantastic wings. So, deflated balloon Matthew and Stephen hopped on Yelp to find a place nearby. We settled on Rosamunde Sausage Grill, and boy, am I glad we did.



With a renewed desire to live, we continued to explore, heading farther west (farther away from the apartment) until we came to Buena Vista Park. Stephen said that the view from the top of the giant hill had a great view, so I gritted through the foot pain (not in silence, by the way. I was pretty whiny. I’m not proud.) and climbed up the hill. From the top, I could see the entire part of the city that was north of the park. I saw Fisherman’s Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance, but I didn’t really know what I was looking at aside from that. It was beautiful nonetheless.

Down in the city, there’s so much movement and noise—people, dogs, traffic—and then after climbing the hill, there’s nothing but calm. All I could see was a serene cityscape with the Bay in the distance. It was really something to behold. A camera just can’t capture it, though I tried my darnedest.



After resting and taking in the view for a while, Stephen and I went down the hill, stopping to watch some dogs play in a dog run as we made our way down. Once we got back to Haight, Stephen said that we were pretty close to Haight-Ashbury, so we should go explore it, too.

Haight-Ashbury is a neighborhood that’s got a hippie history. The area was pretty central in the Summer of Love and the whole 1960s era. And you could tell.

Stephen and I went into a weed store because we were amazed that you could just walk into a store and openly talk about weed. There was some ‘Magic Butter’ maker. Apparently you just add your ingredients (one of which is your weed), and it just makes you some weed butter. I had no idea stuff like this existed, y’all.

So, we walked around that store a bit. It was mostly t-shirts and bongs—it wasn’t actually a dispensary. After that, we went to a pipe store to see if Stephen could find a cheap tobacco pipe, as he’d forgotten his in Ohio. They had some really cool Hobbit pipes—almost cool enough to make me want to take up smoking. Stephen found a wood pipe, so the trip was a success. We were ready to head home, which was 3 miles away up and down a bunch of hills.

Luckily, the city’s beautiful. Otherwise, the walk would have been boring on top of being painful. We stopped at Trader Joe’s on the way back, which is thankfully just a couple of blocks away from our apartment.

The rest of the day involved a lot of sitting in my comfy pants.

Thursday

Thursday, we did a lot less walking. We wanted to clock the time it would take to get to DBC and see what the route looked like. To get to DBC, we walk up the hill our apartment is on to get to California Street. From there, it’s about a half-mile walk downhill and that’s it. Less than a ten-minute commute, which is awesome.

My least favorite part about my job at Savvis in St. Louis was the commute. It took at least twenty minutes of driving, maybe a half hour or more if there was traffic (there was usually traffic). Sitting in traffic is one of the most soul-sucking activities I’ve ever experienced, so I’m stoked to be able to walk everywhere or be driven by a bus or Uber driver in San Francisco.

DBC is right by Chinatown. So, we walked up and down a couple of blocks to see what kind of eateries and stores Chinatown had. A loooot of dim sum places that we’ll be going to for lunch, some bakeries that looked awesome, and some stores that look worth exploring.

In the afternoon, my Aunt Queena and  Desiree picked me up to take me to lunch. Most of my mom’s side of the family lives out in the San Francisco area. Her aunt, Queena, and Queena’s daughter, Desiree, both live in the Marina District, and they wanted to take me out to lunch.

It was my first time really meeting them, so it was great to finally see them. They were both awesome—so talkative and Italian and friendly. Aunt Queena is about 4’6” and says ‘honey’ all the time, so it was really cool to meet her.

They took me to an Italian restaurant that they both enjoy. Aunt Queena said she’s known the owner, Dario, since he opened the restaurant eight years ago. They chatted in Italian, and Dario sent us out some bruschetta. The food was fantastic, and Desiree and Aunt Queena just kept jumping from topic to topic. They’d start a story about one thing, and something in the story triggered another thought, so they would start on a new story. And it just kept going on and on, and they kept interrupting each other, and it was great.

After that, they took me to the church that my great grandparents, my nonno, and Aunt Queena all got married in. It was also the church where my mom and her siblings were baptized in.

Then we drove through the Wharf, so I got to see all of the fishing boats, restaurants, and yachts. I had the windows down to experience the breeze of the perfect sunny day and the smells of all the restaurants. It took me back to the beach in Florida during our summer trips there.

They dropped me off, and then the rest of the night was spent doing some work and prep for DBC.

I can see why people really like it here.
