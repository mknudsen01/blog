It’s New Year’s. It’s hard to believe that it’s already a new year—I feel like it just turned to 2013. When the end of the year comes, I always get a bit more pensive than normal, thinking about whether I did this year right and what I want for myself in the new year.

Usually, I feel pretty bad about myself at the end of the year because I feel like I don’t have a whole hell of a lot to show for the year. But this year, I’m feeling a little bit better. I’ve definitely seen some movement forward for myself, and I’m pretty happy about it. Some of the stuff that I did this year:

I made a website.

For my senior project at Arizona State, I decided to make a website. I made it because it didn’t involve writing a paper on a research topic in either the accounting or finance field. I’d taken a database introduction course as part of my accounting degree, and I really enjoyed it. As such, I wanted to make a website that used databases, and I did! It took a lot of googling, looking at web tutorials and Stack Overflow, but I was able to piece together a basic website: http://bookmeetups.com/. The website’s kind of a piece of crap, but it’s something that I MADE.

I’ve never really had that same feeling of accomplishment before. Usually, my feeling of accomplishment was keeping my good grades high by scoring well on a test or homework. The feeling of getting a good grade really isn’t that great, especially after I realized (really unfortunately late) that grades don’t mean anything. At that point, I was hating my homework, hating my degree, and hating all of my school reading because I didn’t believe in any of it.

But I believed in my website project. I had something that I was working towards, a real goal. Every day, I felt good about myself because I got one step closer to that goal, and when I finally finished it and presented it, I felt great. I had finally made something that I could be proud of, something that I knew that I made from scratch.

I graduated from college.

It wasn’t really ever a question of whether I would graduate from college. From grade school, I had my plan to get good grades, get into a good college, and get a job after it. But it still felt wonderful to really finish. It’s a new chapter in life. I wasn’t really a huge fan of college—which was probably of my own doing—so I am happy to put it behind me. I feel like the few years after college are the really great ones. Becoming self-sufficient, contributing to society, getting away from all of the college-kid atmosphere, and having some disposable income before I consider having a family. It all just sounds great to me, so I’m stoked to experience it.

I lived in the same city as my girlfriend for the first time in four years.

My girlfriend, Grace, and I started dating about midway through our senior year of high school. A few months later, I made my decision to go to ASU even though she was going to school in St. Louis at the College of Pharmacy there. It was a fledgling relationship that was years in the making, so it was terrifying to put 1,500 miles between us for most of the next 4 years. Neither of us wanted it to end, so we tried to make the long distance work. And we did!

Once I graduated, I moved to St. Louis in June. After 4 years, Grace and I were finally in the same city, and it felt absolutely wonderful to be able to drive to her apartment in 10 minutes or to be able to meet her for lunch instead of having to hop on a plane for a short weekend visit.

I turned down the job I’d been working towards for 10 years.

Starting in about 7th grade, I really started thinking about my future. I decided that what I wanted was to focus on grades, so that I could get a stable, well-paying job, so that I could get married, so that I could start a family. That was the life I wanted. I didn’t have any inkling of what kind of job I wanted in 7th grade, I just knew that I wanted one. I really had no direction planned out except for “get good grades all the time.” Eventually, I ended up in accounting and got a summer internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest public accounting firm in the world.

At the end of the internship (summer 2012), they offered me a job. I worked my ass off in school and wound up with a job offer in the public accounting field. It was stable. It paid well enough. It had lots of room for upward mobility. It’s what I had wanted for ten years! But I didn’t feel excited about it at all. What I had wanted all of those years was shallow and stupid. For ten years, I didn’t care where I ended up as long as I could get promoted and get more money.

I didn’t understand or realize how shallow and stupid I was until I did my senior project and made a website. All through school and at my internship, I wasn’t really excited about the reading or the work. I just thought that’s how it was for people in life—you had a job you were ‘meh’ on, you studied something in college that you were ‘meh’ on, and you lived a life you were ‘meh’ on.

Then I made my website. I had a project that interested and challenged me. I was actually building something from scratch, and it just felt so cool. I couldn’t go back to accounting after that. I wanted to try my hand at web development—get a real understanding of it, immerse myself in it, and see where it could take me. I looked around for some ways to learn web development quickly, and I found Dev Bootcamp.

I was enrolled in Dev Bootcamp with every intention of looking for a job in web development once I finished. I had already accepted my offer from PwC, though. When I told PwC that there was a chance that I wasn’t going to be working for them anymore, they wanted a definite yes or no.

Shit.

I’d been working towards a job like PwC for the last ten years of my life. I put schoolwork above everything and said no to a lot of friends and activities to focus on school. Saying no to PwC felt like throwing those last ten years away.

But at the same time, I thought about what my life would be like if I took the job. Long hours helping make 10Ks and 10Qs and office politics that would make me hate myself.

There’s no reason to do that. There’s no reason for a 22-year-old to be worrying about IRAs, salary, benefits, and office politics. These are the years that I should be getting life experience, traveling, and learning about the things I actually care about. As this article puts it, these are the years that I should be selfish.

Once I start working at PwC, the job will drain me. Working on something that we don’t love takes a lot out of us. If I do that for 8 to 10 hours a day, I’ll be exhausted by the time I get home, and it’ll be ridiculously hard to start traveling, to learn web development or anything else I might want to learn, or to start my own businesses (which I want to do eventually). Why would I put myself in an unhappy hole I can’t climb out of for the next 40 years just because I’m too worried to “throw away” my high school and college work? Easy. I wouldn’t.

So, I gathered up what bits of courage I could find and told PwC that I didn’t want the job. I’m super nervous about where the decision will take me, but I can’t wait to see how it unfolds in the new year.

What do I want for this year, though? I used to be big on resolutions at the beginning of the year—I’m gonna write every day, work out every day, eat healthy every meal—but those never work. It’s not possible to stop all of these bad habits and start all of these good habits in one day.

There are still habits that I want to build this year, though, and some other habits that I want to break. It just can’t be a “I’ll do this every day” or “I’ll never do this ever again” kind of attitude. Small steps every day. But the things that I want to get better at:

Being myself

There’s always been a huge disconnect between who I am with my family and closest friends and who I am with people I’m just meeting or am not super comfortable around. I begin to feel inferior around those people, as if my opinion no longer matters or my opinion is stupid. I want everyone to like me, so I don’t tell my jokes, sing, ask questions, talk too much or step on any toes when around people I don’t know as well. I don’t like that about myself, so I want to be comfortable Matthew around more people and in more social circumstances, even when I’m not necessarily comfortable. Especially at Dev Bootcamp. I want everyone to get to know the real Matthew and not worry about everyone liking me.

Eating more healthfully

My diet is complete garbage. I still have some irrational fear that vegetables are physically harmful to me. I’ll see someone eating some cauliflower and think that’s neat, but when I go to eat it, I worry that I’ll die if I eat it.

I would like for that to stop. I want to take the extra time to prepare vegetables and fruits with my meals because I enjoy them. I’ve made some progress recently—I’m eating some fruit most days, cutting back on the soda, and trying any vegetables that I come into contact with. A little bit every day or so and I’ll get my palate more mature than that of a five-year-old’s.

Learning web development

This is something that I want to do most days. Not some hardass rule of “work for 5 hours on web development every day.” But I do want to learn some small bit of web development every day. Maybe it’s reflecting on something I did earlier. Maybe it’s working on a pet project. Maybe it’s working for a bit on a challenge for Dev Bootcamp, for Ruby Quiz, or Project Euler. Maybe it’s just reading an article or some of a book pertaining to development or design. It doesn’t need to be big, but I do want to be working towards become a great web developer or designer every day.

It’s gonna be an exciting year. Here’s hoping it’s our best one yet!
