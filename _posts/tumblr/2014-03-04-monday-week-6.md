I was feeling pretty good all day today. I got to pair with Stephen, and we learned about something really cool today—APIs.

APIs, or application programming interfaces, allow for websites to connect to the data of other websites. Today, we learned about Twitter. We made a simple web page that essentially “signed in” as Stephen’s Twitter account. From there, we were able to write some programs to access tweets.

We completed a challenge that involved searching for the most recent tweets for a user. We could type into a box whichever Twitter handle we wanted, and it would fetch the user’s ten most recent tweets and display them on the screen.

Today was really empowering. I made my first website that talks to other websites. I can start to do some really cool things with APIs. A number of sites have APIs—Twitter, Facebook, Google, Goodreads, Amazon, etc.

With access to the data of these websites, I’m only limited by my imagination in what I can build, so I’m really excited.

I’ve been feeling really great recently. I had an appointment with Sefora today, and I really didn’t know what to talk about with her. We pretty much just talked about how well things went last weekend.

She encouraged me to think about why things were going very well. Why wasn’t I stressed? Why wasn’t I freaking out or feeling social anxiety? Whenever things go wrong, we think about why they did. We try to piece together the sequence of actions/events/behaviors that led to our demise.

When things go right, though, we just ride the wave of success/happiness without really thinking how it came about. Did we work really hard? Did we make some sacrifices? Did we have a certain mindset? Something great for breakfast? Exercise? Get more sleep? What were some of the factors that got us successful?

I hadn’t thought about it at all when Sefora asked, so I had to give it a couple of minutes. And then I thought back and realized that I didn’t feel stressed over the weekend. I had some confidence. I was confident that I was going to get the group project done with my team, and that we would get it done well. I was confident that I would be able to get my portfolio challenges done. And I was confident that I could even take some time in the evenings to relax or some time in the mornings to sleep in.

I also gained some confidence in teaching some fellow boots about object-oriented JavaScript. I don’t know if I taught them well, but I do at least know that I cemented my understanding. They were working on the challenges that I had just struggled with. We were remaking them from scratch, and I had a really good sense of what needed to connect to what in our program and how to do it.

Learning happens two ways—when we learn something ourselves, and when we teach it to others. When we teach, we get a sense of how well we know a topic. We see where we’re strong and where we have some gaps in our knowledge while we’re helping someone else to learn. Symbiosis, folks.

But this weekend, I played some games, stayed up late, slept in, worked hard, had some beer, taught some JavaScript, and had an awesome time. Something that I didn’t do was sit and thnk about all of the things that I could be doing while I was doing something.

I think part of that might be the nature of how we receive assignments this phase. Phase 1, we got a zillion challenges and were encouraged to pursue the ones that were interesting to us.

Much too much decision paralysis for Matthew.

In Phase 2, though, we’re give just a few assignments and told that we need to do them. I like that structure. I have way too much trouble making decisions about how I should spend my time. If I just pick a thing and am happy with it, I work hard and get it done well without worrying. Usually, I think about how I would be happier doing something else, though, so I end up losing focus.

So, this phase, being told which assignments we need to do (but also being given some freedom in how we want to make it, what we want it to look like, and what optional features we want to add to it) has really helped.

This weekend, I knew the five things that I had to do. If my team wanted to work on the team project, I worked on the team project. It had to get done over the weekend. If they weren’t all working on it, then I could do my four portfolio challenges, as they also needed to get done. And there was an order to getting them done, so I only had one thing that I was supposed to be doing at any one time. It made it much easier for me.

Tomorrow, we get a solo day to finish up our portfolio challenges, so that will be great. On both of them, I’ll get to practice my object-oriented JavaScript. And on one, I get to explore an API of my choice. It should be a lot of fun.
