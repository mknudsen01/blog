I’m in Phase 3! Two thirds of the way done with Dev Bootcamp. Whaaaat? How did that happen?

I’m starting to worry about jobs and what’s coming after Dev Bootcamp. I think I want to stay in San Francisco and look for jobs here (and some other cities like Seattle, St. Louis, and maybe Portland and possibly Denver). Sheesh, who knows.

The problem is that I only have my apartment for three weeks after Phase 3 is over. And it typically takes longer than three weeks to find a job. Dev Bootcamp told us to expect possibly three months or so to find something that’s a good fit for us.

That leaves Matthew homeless for a couple of months. Unless he bites the bullet and gets an apartment or lives in a hostel. But that costs money. And money is hard to find when you don’t have a job.

So, it’s going to be an interesting decision. How long can I afford to stay in San Francisco and look for a job with no income? I don’t really have a nest egg of any sort.

But that’s future Matthew’s problem.

For right now, I want to talk about how excited I am for Phase 3. On Friday, the four teams from the Sea Lions presented their final projects. I’ve only got the links for three of them right now: Hattip, Backlyne, Noodle Skoodle, and BAC Monkey.

All of them were kind of awesome. Hattip allows for people to donate money to street performers. It will eventually get up and running to show you all of the popular YouTube videos of successful street performers, and you can send them money through Stripe (or Bitcoin!) to show your appreciation. That way, street performers will get more exposure and will make more money than they would just doing their work on a street corner.

Backlyne handles most of the business side of starting a small business. It’s focused on music teachers, and it allows them to collect money from students, give out assignments, and contact their students, all from one website. And it looks really good. The sheer number of features blew my mind while I was watching the presentation.

Noodle Skoodle was also a really cool idea. There are a lot of organizations that offer free courses—Coursera, MIT, edX, and so on. But if you want to learn about something, you’d have to go to each site to see whether it had the course for you. What this site does is combine all of the sites. You can go to this site, search a topic, and see all of the videos that match that topic that can be taken for free. From there, you can go to the home website and enroll in the course. It makes it much easier to find the free courses that you want to take.

BAC Monkey was also awesome. It helps you keep track of your vices. Be it alcohol, caffeine or nicotine, you can keep track of how much you have in your body at any one time. For example, if you went out to a bar, you can put in how many drinks you’ve had in the last x hours, and the app will tell you your BAC level. From there, you can know if you’re legal to drive, which can help you make not idiotic decisions. And it will help you keep track of how much you smoke or drink coffee. So, maybe if you’re trying to kick the habit slowly, you can track your progress.

All of the ideas were so cool. Each project looked great and was something that I could actually see myself and other people using.

But what was the coolest is that I had no doubt that I could build the websites that they made. Sure, some of the stuff would take some more research, as I’ve not been exposed to it yet. But I could learn everything necessary to make that website. And what’s more, I could see places where I could make the sites even better.

It was really exciting to see the projects. In part because they were really cool. I’d seen the Sea Lions working all last week, so I was excited to see how their final projects would turn out. But mostly because I just know that we can build even better sites for our final projects.

Over these next two weeks, we’ll finally get a lot of exposure with Ruby on Rails. We’ll have some extremely powerful tools at our fingertips, and we’ll be making some really cool stuff with them. I’ve got to spend some time tonight familiarizing myself with Rails so that I’m not totally lost tomorrow.

But I feel ready. Phase 2 was really tough—and there was some burnout near the end—but I feel like I’m ready to get started at full intensity for these last three weeks. Steven and Strand were awesome teachers, and Steven and Shadi are going to be our teachers for Phase 3.

It’s going to be hard. They’re both way super qualified to teach us about Rails and they’re both going to expect a lot form us. I’ll hate them as it’s happening, but I know I’ll be really happy to have had them push us so hard once we get to the end of the program.

Ahhhh!!!!!! It’s happening! In three weeks, I’ll be ready to be a junior developer somewhere. I’ll be equipped to build some legitimate web applications.

My main goal for this phase is the same that I made for myself a couple of weeks ago: not to worry. I think I did a decent job of not worrying last week, but there’s always room for improvement. And there’s going to be a lot of pressure to make a really cool Phase 3 final project, to build side projects for my portfolio, and to find a job in the coming month. I need to make sure I control that stress and keep myself mostly free of worry.

That, and I need to work friggin’ hard.

I’ve started getting up later and later, and I want to nip that habit in the bud. Get up at 7:30. Working until I feel like my brain is mush, and then getting some sleep.

I want to make a pet project each week.

I want to be reading about something new every day.

And I want to start reading a little more for fun.

And I want to start coaching my fellow boots where I can. I think it’d be awesome to be a coach at DBC once I’m done with the program, so I need to start practicing what I would do as a coach. Spending a lot of time teaching my cohort and the cohorts below me whenever I understand something or whenever they’re struggling. Often, I’m worried (there’s that silly word again) about getting my own assignments done, so I neglect helping out others where I can. If I get rid of that worry, I’ll be excited to teach everyone what I already know. I think that’s a huge part of this program of which I haven’t been taking full advantage.

Well, now it looks like I have quite a few goals for this phase. Will I stick to all of them? Most definitely not. But as long as I’m working towards at least one of them every day, I think I’ll be a happy camper.
