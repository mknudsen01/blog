It’s the middle of week 5. I’m halfway done with Dev Bootcamp.

Holy bad word.

I tend to stop and reflect any time I hit a “milestone” in my life. When I finished college. When I moved to St. Louis. When I applied to Dev Bootcamp. When I got in to Dev Bootcamp. When I started each of my three jobs in St. Louis. When I had to quit those three jobs. When I started the DBC prep work. When I moved out here to San Francisco. When I started DBC. When I finished Phase 1. And now the halfway point of DBC. Quite a few milestones in a less than a year means that I probably have a some pretty lax standards regarding what constitutes a milestone, aaaand I don’t really care.

I think it’s good to stop and reflect often. It’s a great habit to take stock regularly. What are your goals? How have your values changed? What progress have you made since you last reflected? Has there been any progress? Any regression? Kicking or picking up any bad habits? Are you pushing yourself and failing often?

It doesn’t take long to do. Just take half an hour or so to write out some thoughts—goals, accomplishments, failures, how much you liked what you had for breakfast, whatever. There’s a great website that I go to when I just want to write out some thoughts, stream-of-consciousness style. It’s a site called 750 Words. The idea is—you guessed it!—to write 750 words every day.

The website creator’s idea came from a book he read called The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron. The idea is that you write 750 words every morning, as soon as you wake up. You don’t censor yourself—you just write whatever comes to mind for at least 750 words. In 750 words, it’s tough just to write out purely superficial nonsense. After a few hundred words, you kind of run out of meaningless things to say. So I notice that I start writing out some thoughts and feelings regarding what’s happened to me. By the time I hit 750, things are usually getting pretty deep. It’s just a cool way to get some thoughts out when you either don’t have someone else to talk to or don’t feel like sharing it with someone else. Plus, it’s fun to write.

So, I did a little bit of reflection on where I’m at with DBC and where I want to get to.

First, I notice that I’m getting better about feeling confident around these people. I’m willing to be silly Matthew with more and more of the people here. People who I’ve never really had serious discussions with. People whose last names I still don’t even know. I typically need to know a lot about a person before I open up to them and act silly with them. Maybe it’s just seeing them every day that makes me feel like I know them and can be myself around them. Maybe I’m gaining more confidence. Either way, I’m noticing that I’m being louder, telling more jokes, speaking up more, singing a lot more, and just acting like typical Matthew instead of quiet, scared, unsure Matthew. Cool stuff.

I’m also noticing that during Phase 2, I’ve stopped worrying so much about the need to be social. The past few days, I’ve been putting my headphones on and working for hours at a time. And I’ve taken some naps at lunch. I’m not super worried that the entire world is going to end if I miss a fun conversation or a chance to chat with someone.

I still do chat with them and ask for help. I’m just getting better at being able to sit and work when I need to sit and work, which is something that I struggled with in Phase 1.

I’m not feeling on top of everything I’m learning anymore. I’m not finishing the challenges very quickly. I’m not always approaching the problems in the optimal way. I’ll spin my wheels for a while and have virtually no idea what to do next. I’m uncomfortable and swimming in confusion.

I’m not seeing these failure as a bad thing, though. I’m learning at my own pace. In school, it really matters to keep up with the rest of the class because you’re grades are usually based on your position relative to the rest of the students.

Here, keeping up still matters, but we’re not being ranked or graded. We’re just being pushed to learn as much as we can because our teachers want us to be prepared for real jobs once we get done here. Failing at something isn’t shameful because that’s how we learn.

If all we do is succeed and complete challenges with ease, then we’re not accomplishing anything. We learn by failing. We learn by going outside of our comfort zones. We learn by reaching just beyond our capabilities. The step right after confusion (assuming we don’t give up) is knowledge. All of these code challenge failures are teaching me. The faster and more often I fail, the more I’ll know by the time I get out of here.

I have one main goal for the rest of the time I’m here, and that’s to have fun. If I’m having fun and not feeling stressed, I’ll reach out to more people, I’ll be more engaged in the conversations that I have, I’ll be more willing to try and fail on my code challenges, and I’ll absorb more.

When we’re in a state of play, we’re the most receptive and the most creative in our thinking and learning. Just by enjoying myself during this whole life thing, I’ll become a better boot, a better friend, a better student, a better boyfriend, a better learner, a better everything.

Plus, I’ll be having fun if I’m having fun, and that’s always fun.
