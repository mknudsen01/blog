When someone asks me What do you do for work?, I tense up. Questions make me nervous. Having the spotlight on me is off-putting, and I tend to overthink the question. Is this person actually interested? How much do they really want to know? How long should my answer be? Where should I go into more detail about what I do?

I tend to assume that people are less than interested in what I’m saying, so to avoid boring them with the details of my life, I go through my answer as quickly as I can so that I can ask them about what they do instead of talk about myself.

Oh I work at XYZ in a dull accounting role haha it sucks I hate it but it’s just a temporary job. What do you do?

Booooooo. Hisssssss.

Just a crappy answer. I exude zero self-confidence, I leave no doors open for them to ask me more, and I cut the conversation off. I give no information about my job AND I immediately switch the conversation back over to them. In one run-on sentence, I’ve made myself seem unconfident, standoff-ish, or maybe just a little off-ish.

I make no mention that the job is to save money for San Francisco because I’m headed out there in January (just a week away now!). I make no mention that San Francisco is where I’m going to try to learn web development at Dev Bootcamp. I’ve just cut the entire conversation about myself off before it even really starts.

People ask that question to try to connect. If I know literally nothing about you, I at least know that you need to earn money somehow. If you tell me what you do for a living, that might lead somewhere else—maybe someone I know has that same job, maybe I’ve always wanted to know what that job entails, maybe I saw a movie or read a book that mentioned that job. Any of the above could spark a conversation, and then we could move on to some of the deeper stuff.

Right now, I pretty much limit myself to answering the question directly, telling the person how it is that I make money. I hate talking just about how I make money, though, as I’ve never really been proud of my job. If someone wants to connect, then there are things that we can talk about that interest me far more than my job. So, to answer the question with stuff I like more than my job, I can change my idea of what the question’s asking. If they’re asking me about my job, there’s no reason that needs to mean the place I go every day to make money.

Because that’s not my job right now. My job isn’t some boring accounting position that I dislike—that’s just a means to an end. My real job is what I’m working towards. I want to be a web developer, so MY JOB is anything that gets me closer to making web development a reality—reading books, making websites, practicing touch typing, solving coding challenges, even making money so that I can afford to go out to San Francisco. They’re all just parts of my real job.

By changing my connotation of job to more than what I do to make money, I can give a more open answer, one that invites questions and fosters connection.

A huge part of my current job, then, is Dev Bootcamp—saving money for it and preparing for it.

After college, I realized that I didn’t like the career options that my finance and accounting degrees presented me. Instead, I liked what I did for my senior project better—making a website.

It was a fun project for me, and I want to get really good at web design and web development. Once I figured out that I want to work with the web, I had a few options.

I could go back to college and get a degree in computer science.

I could get a job in accounting or finance and learn web development on my own in my free time.

I could skip the job, go all out on web development, and get good enough to support myself within a year.

I’d been in school for the last sixteen years. I didn’t want to take on debt and go to school for another few years to get a degree. And the more I worked with and studied web development, the more the thought of pursuing an accounting career made me sick to my stomach.

That left trying to find a way to learn web development really quickly. That’s where Dev Bootcamp came in.

When I tell someone that I’m going to Dev Bootcamp, they usually don’t know what I’m talking about. Which is fair. Why would you know what I’m talking about? It’s a program that’s only been around for two or so years, and it’s not something that you just come across unless you read a tech news site around the time it was getting media attention or you spent your spare time exploring ways to learn code fairly quickly.

So, let me tell you about it.

Dev Bootcamp is a 9-week, intensive web development program, with locations currently in San Francisco, Chicago and New York. It aims to teach us everything that we need in order to become junior web developers—“world-class beginners,” as the founders and teachers say—people who know enough to where a company will actually pay us to keep learning.

The nine-week program in which I’m enrolled begins on January 27th in San Francisco. For the 12 weeks leading up to the program, boots (students enrolled in the program) are assigned weekly challenges and readings, getting the most basic building blocks of the web out of the way so that we can really dive deep when we come together with the teachers and our fellow boots in San Francisco.

The main focus of Dev Bootcamp is to teach us an application framework called Ruby on Rails. There are a number of different programming languages, one of which is called Ruby. The application framework Ruby on Rails makes it easier to create database-backed web applications, and it is written in the Ruby language.

A database-backed web application is pretty much any site that holds data. Any website that you “log in” to has to store your login credentials in a database. Any website that has articles, blog posts, videos, pictures, or status updates has to store that data somewhere. Any clothing sites or sites where you buy other products are made with a database of information, too.

Ruby on Rails is a framework that makes it a bit easier to organize and to create these web applications, from the databases to the actual look of the website. Dev Bootcamp is going to teach me how to navigate and work with that framework.

To use the framework to create websites, though, I need to learn more than just the Ruby language in which the framework is written. There are many other languages that are used to make a website—languages to build the structural layer of a website, to change the look of a website, to add interactivity to the website, and to retrieve and display the data held in the database for a website. The 12 weeks leading up to Dev Bootcamp have been focusing on the languages and tools that I need to know in order to work with the Ruby on Rails framework.

So, for the past twelve weeks, I’ve been learning Ruby, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and its jQuery library, SQL and Git.

Ruby is the language with which the Rails framework is built.

HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the language that forms the structural layer of a website. Any website that you go to uses HTML to tell the computer what order headers, paragraphs, links, images and the like should appear on a website. Bear with me—I’ll show you a picture of what I mean.

CSS, or cascading style sheets, are used to alter the aesthetics of a website. They’re used to change colors, sizes, borders, margins, padding, the layout of the website—everything that makes a site pretty.

As an example, here’s what the Facebook login page looks like with just HTML:



As you can see, it’s got all of the text, all of the links, and all of the images of the home page, but it looks awful. It’s just the structural layer of the web page—the skeleton. Now, if we add the CSS, it will look like the normal login page:



Javascript is a powerful language that can be used for a variety of tasks. It can validate user input, add interactivity to a website, create cookies so that your computer remembers your information for websites you’ve visited, and to change page contents without having to reload the entire webpage. Maybe you’ve seen some signup forms for websites that will tell you, as you’re typing, whether a username is already taken or if a password satisfies all of the requirements.

Pretend to sign up for an account at Mint. Enter an email address without an @ symbol. Or type a password that’s two letters long. You’ll notice that an error pops up without you needing to reload the page. That’s Javascript.

Or maybe you’ve clicked on a photo on a website, and the web page creates a lightbox that displays an enlarged version of a picture while graying out the rest of the website:



The lightbox doesn’t send you to a new page on the website—it will take you right back to the page you were on once you close the photo. Javascript is just adding some interactivity to the page. These examples don’t even begin to scratch the surface of what javascript can do now, though. Entire websites are being built with just Javascript now, like this one.

jQuery is a library for Javascript that makes Javascript code simpler to write. For example, we can change the background color of this webpage. To do this, you’ll need to open up your developer tools and then open up your console. On Chrome, you can do this by pressing Cmd+Option+J (on Windows, it would be Ctrl+Shift+J).

With Javascript, the code you could write (or copy) into the console would be: 
document.getElementsByTagName(''body'')[0].style.backgroundColor = "green";

With jQuery, that command can be shortened to $(''body'').css({''background-color'': ''blue''});

jQuery makes the code shorter and more readable. Javascript (and jQuery) can be used to make some pretty amazing functionality for websites.

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is one of the languages that can be used to create, read, update and delete information from a website’s database. If, for example, you sign up for a website or change your password, SQL is what’s used to put the new information in the database so that your new account or password works.

Git isn’t really a language to write code. Git is what’s called a version control system. Basically, it allows you to take a snapshot of a web project. That way, if you add or remove features from a website, you can do so knowing that you won’t destroy your starting code.

It’s a bit like writing a paper. Once you’ve got your rough draft, you start messing around with your writing. You might add paragraphs, delete some information, or move some ideas around. When you save it after the edits, though, you might not want to get rid of the rough draft, so you save the new version as a second draft, or a third or fourth as you continue to make edits. That way, if you decide you want to go back to how you wrote something in an older draft, you’ll still have the older drafts to look at. A version control system is pretty much the same thing, except with code.

These about cover the basics that I’ve been studying. Once I actually get to Dev Bootcamp, there will be more languages and languages to learn, some of which I’ve not heard of or researched: SASS (used to make writing CSS easier and more powerfully), AJAX (not really sure), Coffeescript (similar to SASS, but for Javascript), HAML (no idea yet), and I’m sure numerous others.

Once I get a solid footing with all of the above, I’ll spend the last three weeks of the program building an actual web application with a small team of fellow boots.

At the end of the nine weeks, Dev Bootcamp invites employer representatives to come meet us—a sort of “career fair” day. At this time, we speak to companies about the projects that we made and about ourselves so that we may contact them later to explore career opportunities.

Dev Bootcamp has something around a 90% job placement rate after a month or so for its boots as a whole, so ideally I’ll end up with an offer after applying to a bunch of companies after the camp.

The entire program accelerates our learning by teaching us hands-on for long hours with a group of equally-dedicated fellow boots (there are around 20 total boots in each cohort). Rather than teach us a bunch of concepts and then having us apply some of them to a project, we’ll be told that we’re building a project—say a Sudoku solver—and then learn about the concepts that are required to build it. In this way, it’s a very hands-on, immersive, experimentation-driven form of learning.

Dev Bootcamp also focuses on team learning and emotional intelligence. It’s not aimed just to teach us the code. It teaches us in such a way that we get better at working in teams, at making our opinions known, and at giving and receiving constructive feedback. We’ll get a sense of what it’s actually like to work as an entry-level web developer.

If all goes according to plan, by the end of the nine weeks, I’ll be a world-class beginner with a position as an entry-level web developer.

Thanks for reading all the way through. If you want to know more about the program or have any questions about what it is and what I’m learning, please reach out!
