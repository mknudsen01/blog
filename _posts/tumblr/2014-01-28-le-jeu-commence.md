Day 1 at Dev Bootcamp.

Holy hell.

One of the most awesome things about Dev Bootcamp is how it flies in the face of typical education. Here, there aren’t really rules to follow, tests to take, or things you absolutely need to get done. There are competencies that the leaders want us to have, and so long as we find a way to acquire them, we’re good. They have challenges and readings that will help us get there, but it’s not as if someone is looking through all of the code you post and giving you a grade on it.

It’s incredibly freeing. But it’s also terrifying.

I’ve never had this kind of freedom. I have mildly severe decision paralysis and often carry around a healthy dose of self-doubt. I very often either don’t know what to do or spend my time wondering whether what I chose to do was the best choice. Either way, I end up focusing on the choices instead of just picking something and doing it 100%. It’s definitely going to take a great deal of practice to force myself to pay attention only to what I’m doing.

And I can’t wait to make it happen.

I was really jittery and nervous coming in today. We got there about fifteen minutes early and had to wait outside the DBC rooms. I was freaking out, anxious to get started now that it was so close. Then there was just cheering and banging on the walls. They opened the door and we ran through, high-fiving everyone. It reminded me of when the parents all made a little tunnel for us after soccer games as a kid.

We all introduced ourselves afterwards. It was cool to get to see all of the staff and the cohort that got to DBC three weeks before us. They all gave us some snippets of advice and told us their names. That part was very cool. What the Banana Slugs (that’s our cohort) had to do was introduce ourselves, say why we were in DBC, something we love and something quirky about ourselves.

Baaaghghghg. I hate having to tell people something that I think is interesting or quirky about myself. Then I’m thinking about the best thing to say the entire time before I talk. I don’t really pay attention to what everyone else is saying because I’m worried about saying something stupid once it’s my turn.

Again, decision paralysis and self-doubt.

Most of the day was spent talking instead coding. What to expect, our schedule, when to go to yoga, how to sign up for counseling sessions, etc. Between the reading, the challenges, the discussions we can attend, and the events they put on for us, there’s going to be a lot going on.

I’m trying not to let myself be overwhelmed because it was the first day and of course there’s going to be a lot happening. I should give myself a couple of days to get acclimated, see how everyone behaves, and talk to the staff and Sea Lions (the cohort that started three weeks before us) and see what advice they may have.

Trying not to be overwhelmed but failing. But kind of in the best way. I know I’m going to come out on the other side way lot smarter and more competent.

For the next three weeks, we’re in Phase 1. We’re going to have two main teachers leading us through the three weeks. My teachers are Sherif (we pronounce it like “sheriff” so as not to confuse him with Shereef, the founder) and Shadi (his last name, pronounced like shade-y).

Both of them seem fantastic. The coaches all said to us that they were fairly jealous because those are probably the two best teachers at DBC.

And I can see why. Sherif especially was just so intelligent and so in love with coding. He didn’t use any filler words—um, like,etc.—so I was just in awe listening to him. Some of us joked that we wanted to record it and fall asleep to it.

Sherif said something to us all today that I think was my favorite thing to hear all day. After telling us his story about how he’d spent years becoming a decent developer, he asked us a question:

How many of you really think you can become a web developer in nine weeks?

How many of you? And just the way he asked you made you feel like a complete idiot for thinking that it was possible.

And that’s what he said. After a few of us still raised our hands, he said: I think you’re all delusional. Seriously.

Oh, shit. Thanks, Sherif. Just the pep talk I needed on my first day.

But (and here’s where the magic happened) I think that group delusion is what’s going to give you a chance to succeed.

To be fair, it is kind of crazy to think that you can learn enough to become a web developer in nine weeks. But if we all believe it and push each other and hold each other accountable, we’ll get exponentially farther than we would just coding on our own.

It’s going to be an experience unlike any other. I’m on a team with 22 other people with 20+ staff and coaches, and our objective is just to teach each other and learn as much as we can.

It’s gonna be so much fun.
