Whew. This week was a bit of a toughie.

I was extremely worried coming into this weekend. We had portfolio projects, a group project, and prep to do for next week. It was a bunch of work.

And I let it get to me. I was at Dev Bootcamp pretty much all day Saturday and Sunday. I was here until about 1:30 or so Friday night, and then I was back at 9 Saturday morning. Then I left around 1:15 again last night.

Luckily, there was a bit of respite from the coding on Saturday. For a couple of weeks now, I’ve been trying to see my Uncle Peter and my cousin, Peter Joseph. Our schedules have all been a bit crazy recently. We’ve all got either school or work or Dev Bootcamp, and it seemed like one of us (usually me) was always unavailable.

But the stars aligned on Saturday! Peter Joseph works at a restaurant in Tiburon, and Uncle Peter picked me up to take me to have lunch and see him. AND it just so happened that another of my cousins, Talia, was visiting this weekend from LA. ANDAND my Aunt Chris was also available to come out. I got to see nearly the entire family! (I have another cousin, Nick, who is going to school in Nevada.) I haven’t seen Talia for about about 11 years, and I haven’t seen Aunt Chris or Peter Joseph for about 14 or 15, when we all met up at Yellowstone.

It’s ridiculous how much time it’s been since I saw them, and it was also awesome to see them. We just had some good food and good catching up. Talia reminds me a lot of Emma (my sister), and it was just a lot of fun seeing them. I can’t be with my family while I’m out here, but hanging out with them felt made me feel the same. We haven’t seen each other for over a decade, but it felt like we were just, well, family.

Definitely a fantastic way to spend the afternoon.

The rest of the weekend was spent at Dev Bootcamp, though. Aside from sleeping in until 10 this morning (Sunday) and going to the grocery store, my time has been spent here, working.

There was a lot to do, and I was starting to crack under the pressure. I got into “check this off the list” mode, and that’s not a way I learn well.

I start to rush through things. I read without understanding, and I pretty much throw code at the wall and see what sticks. I was making each coding challenge a task instead of a fun learning opportunity. And that makes each exercise take longer. Which makes me more stressed out. And it’s just a horrible, downward spiral from there.

It sucks to let myself get unhappy like this. I spent a lot of money, left my girlfriend, family, and friends, and took a huge risk to come out here. To study something that I truly enjoy and can see myself doing for the rest of my life. To do something fun and to explore. It’s a shame to let even a minute go by feeling anything less than ecstatic to have the fantastic opportunity to be here at Dev Bootcamp.

So, like, um..don’t do that anymore.

It’s pretty simple. All of this stress is self-imposed. So why not just not impose it on myself?

That’s my goal for the week. Not to feel stressed.

Stress is what ruins everything for me. I stress out about what to say to people I don’t know, so I end up overthinking and saying dumb things. I stress about my workload, so I end up not having fun and not learning as much as I could. I stress about how other boots might have more technical or natural skill in a certain aspect of what we’re learning, so I start to feel inadequate and start to feel that I need to work faster and learnmoreandmoreuntilitbecomesasprintandIdon’teventakenoticeofwhatI’mlearningordoingsoIenduplearninglessthanIwouldhaveifIjustwouldhavetakenmytimeandenjoyedwhatIwasdoing.

So, shoo, stress. You ruin all of the things and are banished from this week.

Because this week is gonna be fun. We’re going to learn about AJAX and jQuery and Javascript and CSS. These are all huge in developing awesome web applications, and I’m stoked to get good at them.

As always, I’ll let you know how it goes.
