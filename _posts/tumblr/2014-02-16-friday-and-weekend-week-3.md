It’s the end of Phase 1!

I’m not sure where the last three weeks went. It feels like I started a couple of days ago and that there’s no way I’ve learned enough about what I need to know in order to move on to Phase 2.

But DBC provided us a list of competencies they expected us to have by the end of the phase, and as I was looking at it yesterday, I was pretty amazed at how many of the 100+ things I was knew.

I guess I didn’t expect to have learned so much because it wasn’t unpleasant. Sure, it was hard work and long hours, but I was just solving puzzles. That’s all that this programming thing feels like to me. Solving design puzzles and logic puzzles. Seeing how all of these pieces can fit together and how patterns I learned about can be applied in new situations to build awesome cool applications.

School wasn’t fun for me. The hours felt like they dragged when I was doing homework or when I was studying, so I developed this notion that gaining knowledge had to be a bit miserable.

Turns out, it doesn’t! It can be fun! And, as Sherif has told us again and again, we learn the most when we’re having fun. When we’re in a state of play and are just experimenting with the different ways that all of these building blocks can be arranged, we learn the most. We’re not worried about getting a grade. We’re not worried about being tested. We’re not worried about showing off our skills. We’re not worried about finding jobs (yet). We’re not worried about any of that because we’re just focused on having fun, solving these challenges.

I used to love playing with blocks and K’Nex and watching my brother play with clay when I was younger. Coding feels just like that for me when I’m working on a challenge. Ruby is my set of grown-up blocks. And soon I’ll be adding more K’Nex when I learn about Sinatra, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Rails, jQuery and whatever else I’m going to be learning in the next six weeks!

On Friday, we finished up our group projects. My group ended up making a cocktail searcher. We were able to grab the data from a website, add that data to our database, and then allow users to search through the database to see what glassware, tasting notes, and ingredients were associated with the drink. We only got to finish our minimum viable product, but it was still really awesome to know that our team made a way to take data from a website and manipulate it.

We gave presentations at the end of the day. We had a group that added celebrities and famous quotes to the Faker gem, and we had a team that slang-ified some Shakespeare. It was awesome.

Before our presentations, though, we saw Phase 2 present the projects that they had built in the last 8 hours. I was blown away at what they were able to do in a single day. Some of them made an application that you could sign in to and add places on Google Maps that you wanted to visit. Another group had an application that graphed the macronutrient data of whatever food you searched for.

THEN AFTER THAT, some of the alumni showed off their final projects. One person presented his group’s project that allowed you to change information on Wikipedia pages and then send the new page to your friends (it was called Makeupedia, and it would be used to back yourself up with “facts” to support your arguments that you had with your friends. Another made an application that would keep track of chores and expenses for roommates. And the coolest one (in my opinion) was an online drum machine that was hooked up to Twitter. You could pick which keywords you wanted to watch for on Twitter and assign the word to one of the drum machine squares. Then, whenever someone tweeted that word, the drum machine button would play its noise. It was amazing.

The whole set of presentations got me really excited for the future. I saw what sort of things I’d be able to build in three weeks. And in six weeks. So I got to wondering what kind of applications I’d be capable of making a couple of months from now. In a year from now. 2 years, 5 years, 10 years and so on. I’m only going to accumulate more knowledge and make cooler and cooler applications, and holy CRUD does it make me excited.

Friday was also Valentine’s Day, though, so it was more than a bit upsetting that I couldn’t see Grace. We’ve been long distance for most of the time we’ve been dating now, so Friday marked the fifth consecutive Valentine’s Day that we didn’t get to be together. We’re 1 for 6 now in seeing each other on V-Day, but next year, it is going to happen.

It’s been tough not seeing Grace for so long. After college was finished and I moved to St. Louis, I was hoping that she and I would be able to be together in the same city for a long time. I got used to being within minutes of her at all times over the 7 or so months I was in St. Louis with her, so it’s been awful not being able to see her. It’s been a month already, and we’ve pretty much decided neither of us can afford to fly out to see the other, so we’ve got at least two more months to go.

She did send me an awesome card for Valentine’s Day, though, so that certainly brightened my day. We’re just going to have to continue to speak when we can, send each other little presents and messages when we can, and make the best of it. It’s sort of a terrible thought, but I’m kind of used to not being around her now, so leaving this time was a lot easier than leaving for college in 2009.

I can’t wait for being apart not to be the norm, though. It’s going to be so cool when we’re both working and living in the same city!

Phase 2 starts tomorrow. I’m super excited because I know that we’ll be learning tons of new languages and frameworks and techniques and will be able to make such cool applications. But I’m also terrified.

We’re going to be learning at a much quicker pace. There’s going to be more reading and way more thrown at us. The learning curve is going to be far steeper than Phase 1, and I’m nervous that I won’t be able to keep up.

But there’s also going to be a new cohort coming in tomorrow! I’m super excited to meet all of the Golden Bears and to help them with the problems that they have in their first three weeks. I’ll have the opportunity to teach the Golden Bears when they’re having trouble, and it’s going to be really exciting to be on the other end of that exchange.

I’ve got to get back to working, though. We’ve got a lot of prep work to finish before tomorrow.
