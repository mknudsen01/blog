I’m gonna like Phase 2 a lot.

After finishing Phase 1, Steven told us that we were programmers. (Maybe not great programmers, but we were able to build local programs and work through logic and learn some of the syntax of Ruby.) By the end of Dev Bootcamp, though, we want to be web programmers.

We’re missing the “web” part. That’s what Phase 2 is all about. We’re going to learn how the Internet works and how servers work. We’re going to make our own servers and make honest-to-goodness web applications. I’ll be able to put projects online instead of only being able to show them to people on the command line.

For the past two days, our lectures have been focused on the Internet. We talked a bit about the Internet “plumbing”—all of the wires and protocols that allow us to use the Internet how we do.

But Steven asked us yesterday how much research we’d ever done into how the Internet works. No one had done any.

It’s crazy! I’ve grown up with the Internet. I’ve used it since first grade or something ridiculous, and yet I’ve never actually bothered with figuring out how it works.

So Steven went over it for us. We now know about the HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. We know about server basics and Rack, the environment hash, middleware, and other things I can’t think of right now! I’m starting to get a grasp of what the Internet actually is, and it’s really cool.

It’s cool to understand more fully something I’ve been using for years. But what’s even cooler is that as I begin to understand, I’ll be able to build with it. Already today we built a basic craigslist. I was right in thinking that it would be a long day—it took me until about 10 to finish up the minimum viable product. There are still a number of features lacking (not to mention it’s hideous), but I still was able to get the foundation of craigslist down on my second day in phase 2. We all were.

i think that’s a pretty amazing accomplishment, and it gets me even more excited to work on our other projects.

Speaking of other projects, there are going to be a lot of them. We’re going to give a lightning talk every week. It’s a five-minute lecture on a programming topic, but it will still be helpful for me to get up in front of a group and speak. I took a public speaking class in college, but I still get terrified in front of groups who are all listening to me.

We’re also going to have group projects. It’s going to be great to work on those because I’ll get tons of practice in working with a team. There are going to be some people with whom I butt heads, and they’ll be stressful projects. It’s gonna be hard. But it’s great practice for life. We won’t always be working with our ideal partners. Plus, I’ll learn how to use Git really well, which is a tool that I’ll be using in my future employment.

We’re also going to have ten portfolio projects. These are going to be our chance to shine. They have deadlines, and they need to be done individually. They’re our chance to show our teachers that we really are learning, as well as to show off to friends or potential employers what we’re capable of building. We were just assigned the first two tonight, and they’ll be due Sunday at midnight.

There’s never going to be a dull moment in Phase 2. And I think it’s going to be really good for me. When I don’t have direct goals that I’m working on, I tend to stall. I sit and wonder what I should be working on for hours and can never be happy with my decision.

i pick option 1, and I think about how life would be better if I would have picked option 2. Then I switch to option 2 and feel as though option 1 would have been better. Should I be social? Should I be working? Should I be reading? I never can decide.

In Phase 2, though, I’ll have deadlines. When I have a portfolio project due in 5 hours, I’m not going to be able to hesitate. There’s really only going to be one course of action. I’ll be focused on one goal. And that’s when I work the best. When I don’t have time to wonder whether I made the right decision on how to spend my time.

I’ve got lots more to be doing tonight, though, so time to go!
