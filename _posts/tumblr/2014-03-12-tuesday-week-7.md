Guuuuuys, I can Rails now.



Oh, thank you, thank you. Please, that’s really too much. Okay, keep going.

I mean, I can’t really Rails yet. But we built our first app today. It was a rehash of an app that we made at the start of Phase 2 to get our bearings with Sinatra.

It’s a basic version of craigslist, and making it allows us to explore how the basics of Rails work. Through the basic CRUD operations, we can learn about routes, helpers, testing, rendering, variable passing, migrations, controllers, and models in Rails, as well as become familiar with the basic file layout.

It was a lot of fun. The craigslist app took me about nine or ten hours to make with Sinatra three weeks ago. Today, Armando and I made a better version in about two and a half hours.

At this rate, it’ll take about forty minutes to make the app in another week.



So, I’m starting to understand how to navigate Rails, which is kind of awesome. It’s really cool how quickly everyone is picking it up, and I’m thinking this cohort is going to make some awesome final projects.

In EVEN HAPPIER NEWS, Grace and I have now been together for five years. Whaaat?! It’s not been a conventional or easy five years. We’ve been long distance for about four of the years. But we’ve made it! Because we rule.

And next year, I’ll (ideally) have disposable income, so I’ll be able to fly out and see her while she’s on one of her rotations! We’ll get to go on dates and stuff!

Anyway, happy anniversary, Gracie!



In far less exciting news, I’ve got to go get back to work. We’re learning about testing this evening, and I’ve gotten about zero of the work done. Tomorrow, we’ll be building our first “big” app with Rails, so that should be way cool.
