If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stay in here and talk with me. I’ll have you feeling like a million bucks by lunch.

Sherif gave us an offer I couldn’t refuse. I was surprised that so many of the boots DID refuse his offer, though. It was only me and one other person who decided to chat with him about how we’re feeling.

I told him what was up. There are all of these topics I want to explore. There are all of these important things to learn, and I don’t feel I have the time to do them. I want to do all of the challenges, I’m struggling with the no grades, I’m struggling with knowing when I have enough mastery of a topic to move on.

And he helped. Among the things we talked about, he showed us this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY.

It’s Ira Glass, the host and producer of This American Life, talking about what’s called the taste gap. For people who are in a creative line of work—be it painting, knitting, making movies, coding, designing, singing, whatever—we first were probably drawn to it because of our interest.

When we had the interest in the topic, we got pretty good at determining whether it was good or not. We developed pretty good taste. The problem is, when we try to jump into creating as opposed to consuming, what we make kind of sucks.

Our poems are weak. Our code is inefficient and ugly. The drawing we made of a window looks like a cat. Our movie script is predictable and dull. Whatever we’re making, we have the taste to know that it’s not very good, and that’s a bit of a disappointment.

It seems that a lot of people give up around that time. I did it with music for a little while. I brought a keyboard out to college because I was going to learn piano. I knew what kind of melodies I liked with piano, and I wanted to make them. After a few weeks, I still wasn’t getting close to making good music, so I quit.

And I’m sure it happens a lot. I don’t want it to happen with coding for me, though. I really have been so excited to be working on these challenges and learning about programming. What I’m making right now, though, is crap. I just need to forgive myself and keep making crappy disappointment after crappy disappointment. Eventually, it will start to improve.

People talk about quality versus quantity, and I used to be on the side of quality. When I made my first website, I wanted it to look super professional and pretty much be perfect. I focused so hard on just stringing together complex topics without really understanding them. I ended up with a website that still didn’t live up to expectations, but I also couldn’t tell you what most of the code was doing.

Quantity is better. I could make thirty crappy websites. But in making those thirty websites, how good would I get at getting the basics in order? How quickly would I be able to buy my domain, get the servers set up, and  begin on my code? With the time that I saved through my improvements, I could slowly introduce more and more complex ideas, always taking care to read about them and understand them because I was in no rush.

Then boom. One day, after a couple hundred websites, I’ll notice that I can quickly implement pretty much any new functionality or design to my sites that I make.

Same with my coding. If I want to get good at recursion, I can just make fifty examples of recursion, slowly introducing a bit more complexity.

This whole perfectionist mindset that I have just isn’t practical as a beginner. I can’t make pretty code or elegant solutions or cool web applications. Yet. But given the time, the exposure, and the practice, then I’ll be great. Once I understand virtually every topic at play, I’ll be able to worry more about writing “the perfect code.”

Bottom line: worrying about my code being sucky is what’s keeping me from being a great coder. If I would just release my inhibitions (and feel the rain on my skin) about my code being ugly or stupid, I could just put my head down and focus on writing some code.

Also, some more Sherif wisdom: we can learn literally anything. Anything that anyone else in the world has learned, I (and you) can learn. Sure, a buttload of effort would need to be put in, but we have the capacity to learn.

That made me feel a lot better about coding. Having seen some really complex projects, I sometimes hop into the mindset that I’ll never be able to write something like that.

Today, we made games. We were supposed to make a pig latin converter, a little racer game, Battleship, and Boggle.

A lot of the work needs to be pushed back to the weekend just because there’s so much else going on. There are coaches to chat with, lectures to listen to, fellow boots to interact with, and rabbit holes to dive down into. Plus, today I had signed up for a counseling session (they’re free! neat!), and we had yoga to go to. It all cuts down on the coding time, but it’s all just as important.

I did manage to get the pig latin converter done with my partner of the day, Brittany. Here’s the code we made:

Pig Latin Converter

The code isn’t great, but the cool thing is that I understood it. I knew how to approach it and implement it, so that was a pretty great feeling.

The Boggle game was far more difficult. We had a lot of trouble implementing the code to see if a specific word could be made on the Boggle board. It involved recursion. When it didn’t work, Brittany and I stared at it for about an hour and a half without being able to fix it, and my mind was turning to mush.

Luckily, Quentin, who I’m convinced is a wizard, was able to help us out. He got it working in a matter of minutes, and it was pretty awe-inspiring.

There’s more I want to write about, but I’m gonna hit the hay. Tomorrow, we’re building a sudoku solver. It’s going to be a beast of a project, and I can’t wait!
