Sunday

Today was going to be all work. It’s the day before Dev Bootcamp, and I still had a couple of projects that I needed to work on. One was for Dev Bootcamp—create a Battleship program. The other was for a family friend of Grace’s—revamp his website.

Both of those were going to take a significant chunk of time. I had to be home for the day.

Buuut then some of the dudes were going to get shoes. I didn’t really need shoes, but the weather was beautiful and this would probably be my last day to explore. Kind of makes it tough to say no. So, I decided to tag along for the ride.

So, we went. Since I don’t really have any extra money to be spending, I told myself that I would be making no purchases. Yet somehow, I walked out of there with a pair of shoes.

Holy hell are shoes expensive. Why are they so expensive? The material Nike uses can’t be crazy expensive. Nike isn’t paying any huge wages in the factories. The shipping costs are probably pretty low because of how much they ship at once. There’s no reason for shoes to be more than fifty bucks! So I was certainly unhappy to pay.

Not unhappy enough not to pay it, though.

Okay, so now I’ve got a new pair of shoes, but I’m back at the apartment. Time for work. I’ve never really revamped a website before, and none of the sites I’ve ever made have looked super professional. This one needs to look great because it’s for someone else.

Then Quentin wanted to get some noodles from Japantown. It’s only a mile and a half away, so we’ll be back soon! I’ve got plenty of time to work.

So, we walked to Japantown, and I got some beef udon from one of the restaurants there. Boy, did I ride the struggle bus trying to use the chop sticks, though. The waitress in the restaurant actually asked me if i wanted a fork because she saw me struggling when she was refilling our waters.

After my struggle, we explored Japantown a bit. We found a Japanese market and then a Korean market. I didn’t recognize most of the food in the shops, so I didn’t buy anything.

But ALRIGHT. Now I’m home. Now it’s time for work. I actually got some fire under my buns and got to it on the website I was supposed to make. It took a few hours, but I was finally happy enough with my first draft to send it out.

Boom. Time for battleship. This is probably the toughest challenge we’ve had to date. There are a lot of moving pieces with it. Some of the dudes who have already finished it said they did it in around 300 lines or 500 lines of code. That’s around three times more going on than the other challenges we’ve had in our pre-work.

As I was spinning my wheels on the project, we decided to start the celebration. Quentin had brought French cheeses and champagne. My Aunt Laurine gave me some salami. And we brought some bread from La Boulange on our way home from Japantown.

It was time to eat/drink it all as celebration of finishing the prep phase of Dev Bootcamp.

After that, work wasn’t really happening. Everyone just got to talking—about the prep work, about the other boots we’d met, about finding jobs, about what to expect with Dev Bootcamp, and other things I can’t really remember at present. Whatever we were talking about, everyone was just kind of off of their computers for a couple of hours, talking.

Then it was ten o’clock, and there was no way that I was going to start the battleship program.

So, all the work didn’t get done, but it was still a great day. It’s been great living with eight other dudes so far. I’m not great at meeting big groups of people. I like to meet the group incrementally and get to know a few people before I move on to the next few. So it’s awesome that I’ve already met eight of the dudes and know them fairly well. If i had to go into Dev Bootcamp tomorrow having to meet 10+ staff and 20 other people, I would freak out. But I have made friends with eight of them already and met four or five others on Saturday night. I’m going in to meet the Dev Bootcamp group already knowing a large chunk of the people, so that’s really helped me to calm down about the first day.

I’m still nervous as hell for tomorrow, though. These next nine weeks will be some of the hardest I’ve faced. I’ll be working more hours than I have before. The work will be far more challenging than any I’ve done. And it’s going to be three months without really getting to talk to Gracie, my family, or my friends as much as I would like to. It’s gonna be tough, and I’m so nervous. But also so excited. I can’t wait to start.
