Today was a little different. We worked alone. We had to finish up our portfolio projects. Most had completed the first eight, so we had to finish up the last two today. Then, with whatever time we had left, we could work on whatever we wanted.

So, I took my time on my projects today. I spent a few hours in the morning on the ninth portfolio project and got the code object-oriented and DRY. I knew how to solve all of my errors, so that was a huge confidence boost.

The tenth portfolio took me a little longer to finish. We were to use an API of our choice and do something with it. I picked the Google Books API, which gives access to all of the books in Google Books. I made three different searches with the API, and it took pretty much the entire afternoon.

Using APIs is awesome. When I made my bookmeetups site, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to get the data for the website populated. I didn’t know how to use APIs, so I ended up putting that burden on users. Users would have to have the title, author, page number, ISBN, and back cover description handy when they wanted to add a book. Then I would also ask them to find a picture of the book online and add it in.

Kind of a lot of hassle to put on a user who just wants to add a new book to their collection. OR, you know, you could harness the power of an API.
The API would allow the user to search with just a couple of keywords. The API would spit out the 10 most relevant searches, the user could click on the one that they actually wanted to add, and BAM! it’s added to the website database.

So much easier. I could make that happen now. It would take a lot of time to make it work, but I have most of the knowledge necessary and would be able to learn the rest.

I think that I might want to propose a revamped Bookmeetups.com as a final project for Phase 3. I would have the ability to add the features that I actually wanted to add.

The premise of the website is that people can add books to their collections, see which other users in their areas have added those same books, and then try to set up a meeting in person to talk about the book. The book is just an excuse—it’s really just about meeting new people in your area who you didn’t know existed based on a mutual interest in a specific book.

Of all of the people I’ve met who liked my favorite book (Shades of Grey, by Jasper Fforde(not the Fifty Shades of Grey nonsense), I have disliked zero of them. If people have the same taste in that one weird book that you love, you’ll probably have a lot more in common with them and could potentially become friends.

I think it would be an awesome thing to have and to use. And now I have the power to make it far more badass.

Users would be able to add their books to the database without next to nil hassle.

Users could put in their location, and I could use Google Maps to show them the halfway point between them as well as show which coffee shops are nearby.

I could connect the appointment times that users set up with Google Calendars or iCal or any other calendar.

I could make it look awesome, run faster, have cleaner code, and just have great user experience.

I’ll either suggest it as a Phase 3 project or make it myself after DBC. Either way, I can’t wait.

In other news, apparently it’s March. Has been for a few days now. Who knew? It was Fat Tuesday today!

Being in DBC, I’m kind of losing touch with the rest of the world. I didn’t hear/read about the Ukraine goings-on until about a week after they started. I didn’t know it was March or Fat Tuesday. I don’t know what’s going on in current events. I’m not sure if the Olympics are still going on or ended weeks ago.

I’m just in this little box, and it’s kind of liberating. When I wasn’t in DBC, I was always surfing the Internet, just taking in all of the noise and doing nothing with it.

I was a consumer. I was contributing nothing. Maybe I’d see something funny or interesting or inspiring, but I wasn’t taking any action.

It’s important not just to be a consumer all of the time. We need to be creators as well. What we create is unimportant—music, code, cocktails, speeches, essays, sales pitches, products, art—it doesn’t matter. It matters that we’re creating something. We all have this innate desire to create, to use our creativity to make something that will improve the world.

Often, we spend too much time consuming, contemplating action but never taking it because we feel we haven’t read enough or haven’t prepared enough or would rather watch Netflix or check Facebook. We have all of this creative potential, but we waste it consuming.

Being in the box that is DBC for fifteen hours a day has been just what I’ve needed. There’s too much to create. There’s no time to get done with the creating, so there’s virtually no time to consume all of the Internet noise.

When we don’t have the ability to consume, it’s kind of amazing how much we can create. Yeah, I don’t know anything about the movies that are out now, some of the current events that are happening, or the Facebook/Twitter minutiae of my friends and acquaintances. But it’s a small price to pay to be having as much fun as I am and to be gaining the skills to create applications on the Internet.

I’ve figured out what I want to create, what I want to make for the world. And in Dev Bootcamp, the noise can’t keep me from learning how to make  it.
