Wellllll I don’t really have much to say about this weekend.

Maybe I do. We’ll see.

Friday, we continued on our projects, building a Stack Overflow clone. I have a rather badass team—Chermaine, Hunter, Armando and Quentin. I don’t wanna say ‘Dream Team,’ buuuuut…



It’s been great working with them. I’ve learned about polymorphism, how Rails deals with AJAX, and gotten some more practice with Rails routing.

I’ve kind of sucked as a teammate this weekend, though. I’ve got a personal project that I’m working on, and so I’ve been distracted. The personal project is something that will tell a user where the nearest bicycle parking is in SF, and it’s gonna be really cool once it’s finished!

The problem is that it’s hard. And it’s taking a fair bit of time. And it’s also really fun. So I’ve wanted to devote the fair bit of time.

Which means that I’ve kind of left my group in the lurch.

Luckily, they’re all awesome and have done an awesome job with the project without me contributing 100% effort.

That still doesn’t make me feel better.

I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself to get this project finished. I’ve started projects in the past but haven’t seen them through. I haven’t put a fire under my bum to get them done, so I get them nearly done and just sort of stop working on them.

I don’t want that to happen for this project. So I’ve been making it a more concerted effort to set deadlines and to reach them. We’re going to start working on our final projects on Wednesday, and I need to be 100% focused when that comes around. I’ve got to finish this project by Tuesday night.

And I don’t think that attitude’s working for me.

It’s adding stress. It’s making me a less-than-stellar group member. It’s keeping me from catching up on the reading that I want to do on Rails.

While the personal project is fun, I’m rushing it, and it’s feeling forced.

In the future, I’m going to avoid setting this hard deadlines for myself. Sure, it’s cool to work harder on something because I know it “needs” to be done by a certain date, but not at the expense of being a solid group member. Not at the expense of having fun.
