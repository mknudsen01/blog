Well, everything is still going well. The weather’s still beautiful, and the city is still a lot of fun to explore.

Friday

I need to start taking some notes every night so that I remember most of what happened in a day. I can’t really remember what happened on Friday morning and afternoon.

Anyway! My Aunt Laurine, Jim (her man), and Nick (her son) picked me up at around 4 to take me around the city a bit and to dinner.

When they picked me up, they had brought me a care package! I got a sleeping bag, apples, salami, crackers, biscotti, parmesan crisps, and an umbrella (which was great because I forgot to bring one).

We drove down to AT&T Park and walked around McCovey Cove, which is  a section of the Bay out beyond right field of the Park. During the games, people will sit out there in boats and kayaks to go after any home runs hit there.



Then we headed to the Wharf. First, we stopped in Ghirardelli Square to get some chocolates.



After that, we walked out onto the Aquatic Park Pier. Holy crap was it beautiful out there. The sun was setting, the Golden Gate Bridge is off in the distance, it was getting a little bit foggy, and it was all just so pretty. I just wish I had stolen Grace’s real camera so that I could have done the scene justice.



It baffles me that there’s this much in the city. So many restaurants, so many businesses and so many cool buildings. That would be enough for most cities. But no. San Francisco has parks. It has tons of restaurants right on the coast with the freshest seafood for sale. And it has the best views, complete with bridges, fog, and hills.

I don’t see what’s missing. I don’t know what else you could want out here so far. Less traffic and less expensive are the only two I’ve got so far.

After the drive and walk, it was time for dinner. We went to a place called Hillstone. Just like everywhere else, the food was delicious. I got some clam chowder, tried a bit of artichoke (not a huge fan), and then got a French Dip and some mashed potatoes. I’d not seen Laurine or Nick in probably eight years, and I’d never met Jim, so we had a lot of catching up to do. It made for a lively, very enjoyable dinner. I’m pleased as punch to be able to be meeting with all of this family that I haven’t seen in so long.

After dinner, we went back to Pier 39 at the Wharf to see the sea lions and get some cinnamon mini donuts that were awesome. Nick wanted to hop on the carousel, so we all got on. Nick and I got into one of those spinning cup things and started to spin as fast as we could. I got close to seeing my dinner a second time. Thankfully, though, everything stayed down and I was just a bit dizzy.

It turned out to be a great night, and I just did some work once I got home.

Saturday

Not a whole lot happened on Saturday morning.

Except I went to a crazy good French bakery. The place is called La Boulange. It’s apparently a chain owned by Starbucks, but Quentin, who’s from France, said that people he knew from France went there when they were a bit homesick.

The place was delicious. I got a chocolate croissant and an espresso. I would have taken a picture, but I ate it all before I thought to. I did snag a picture of Stephen’s latte as well as Quentin’s almond croissant, though.





At about noon, my Uncle Peter picked me up for lunch. I hadn’t seen him since Jeff’s 8th grade confirmation, which would have been about 12 or so years ago.

It was great to see him and catch up a bit. He took me to the R&G Lounge, which is a Chinese restaurant he used to go to a few times a week back when he worked in the city. But we just kind of caught up with our families. He told me about his job as well as my three cousins. One’s working in LA, one’s in Nevada studying journalism, and the other’s studying music at Academy of Art University. They all sound like they’re doing well, and I’m hoping I’ll get to see some or all of them while I’m out here.

For lunch, I got some pan-fried chow mein with chicken. The frying crisps up the noodles, and they put it all in a broth. So, by the time you eat it, some of the noodles are soft and some are still crispy, and it was just delicious.



When I got back, some of the guys wanted to walk down to the Wharf again. I hadn’t gotten to walk around much during the daytime, so I was on board. Before we left, though, we had a pretty lengthy discussion on education. If I’ve not talked to you about my views on the topic, they can pretty much be summed up by these four TED videos. I saw Sir Ken Robinson’s “Do Schools Kill Creativity?” a couple of years ago, and then watched all of the other videos of him I could find. He’s also got a bunch of books out. I’ve only read one, Finding Your Element, and it was great. More recently, I saw Logan LaPlante’s TED talk about his non-traditional schooling experience. That’s the type of schooling I’ll want for my children.

I encourage you to watch all of the videos if you haven’t already seen them.

While we were having the conversation, I noticed that I’m surrounded by a bunch of smart dudes, all of whom had interesting things to add to the education discussion. I’m going to be going into Dev Bootcamp, surrounded by 21 other boots and whoknowshowmany teachers. All of them are going to be smart. All of them are going to be helpful. All of them are going to teach me. And all of them have something to add to the conversations. The thought just made me feel that I’m in such a great position to learn so much.

Anyway, we went to the Wharf, and I saw about a zillion sea lions.



Later on, I got to meet some more of my fellow boots. We went to Jones Lounge to hang out and meet in person. Not everyone came, but I think it was about 13 boots in total.

After hanging out there for a couple of hours, we went to get some Indian food at Chutney. Now, I’d never really had Indian food before. I didn’t get anything wild— a seekh kabab (a beef log), a lamb seekh kabab (a lamb log), tandoori chicken, and paneer naan (cheesy bread). It was all delicious, but I’m not a spicy food guy. Everyone told me that what I was getting was very mild in terms of Indian food, buuuuut I was still getting sweaty.

Though my mouth was on fire, it was still a fun end to the evening.
