I’m feeling sleepy, e’rybody.

Today was not super productive. The lack of sleep, less-than-ideal diet, and lack of exercise are starting to catch up with me. I’m noticing how much I’ve been dragging my feet the past couple of days, especially today.

I want to do all of the things. I want to be reading books, reading articles and blog posts about all of the technical coding goodies that are out there, writing, reviewing code, completing the coding projects we have assigned, and working on my own projects.

But I also need to be taking care of myself—getting adequate sleep, exercising, and eating not just pre-packaged, microwaveable garbage.

And I’ve come to realize that there really isn’t enough time to do all of the things, so I’m going to need to set some stricter (stricter? more strict?) priorities for myself.

What’s most important for me? Do I definitely want to write every day-ish? Do I definitely want to be reading blogs? Working on my own projects? Getting my ‘homework’ done? Is it more important to be reading and learning how all of the things are properly done? Or is it more important to just friggin’ build some stuff?

I tend to lean towards not creating. And just consuming. Reading books and looking at examples without actually creating. Because of the taste gap.

The Taste Gap

Steven, one of our Phase 3 teachers, showed us this quote that Sherif had also showed me during Phase 1. It’s from Ira Glass, the host and producer of This American Life.

“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

That’s what I’m having trouble with. I want to make these things, but I also want them to be really good. So I do all of this reading to learn how to make everything look great and function well.

I’m going to be posting all of the stuff that I make on my Github profile. The code is up for everyone to see. If friends, colleagues, and potential employers are going to look at it, I want it to be perfect. Or at least way better than shoddy.

But that’s what the projects I work on are. I get a little excited that something works the first time I do it. Then I look at it and see that it’s really just a pretty simple thing. I can point out what needs to get better, and so my work ultimately ends up disappointing me.

I know what I want my apps to look like. I know all of the features that I would love for the app to have. And what I actually produce pales in comparison. I’ll see all of these pretty applications and games and will be disappointed that I can’t make them yet.



And while it’s difficult to deal with the taste gap, I also just need to CTFO. I’ve been programming for a couple of months. That’s it. The people who make these sites have been at it for years.

It’s not about making these beautiful sites. It’s about slowly building better and better sites. I might need to make a hundred or a thousand web applications before I’m finally proud of them.

Incremental progress. Each application should do something that I didn’t do on the last one. I should explore one new feature, gem or API. Or implement some new bit of CSS or Javascript or jQuery.

A hundred apps in, I’ll know at least a hundred new things. And I’ll be damn good at making the core functionality work. Slowly, ever so slowly, my apps will look more polished, will have cooler interactive features, and will perform better. With each app, I’ll close the taste gap a teensy bit more.

Right now, I’m a bit daunted because I’m seeing that the gap is a couple miles wide, and I’m only moving a couple of feet a day. It feels like it will take forever to close it.

BUT.

BUTBUT.

That’s the wrong attitude. That’s a horrible attitude. That’s the worst attitude. It’s not about closing the gap in a day. It’s about having fun and being super excited that I’m making any gap-closing progress.

I know. It’s the whole it’s the journey, not the destination cliche. But you know, it really rings true. Focusing on the end makes everything feel like a chore.

Just with a subtle change in perspective, a tiny mindset adjustment, everything could be so much more fun.

Seven weeks ago, I could do next to nothing with a computer. Now, I’m getting a little bored with some of the aspects of putting a bleeping web application online.

That’s friggin’ amazing, folks. The sheer amount of programming that I’ve learned while at DBC would have taken me years on my own. And if I can keep this attitude that coding is awesome (and it really is), I’ll continue to kick ass and to improve while enjoying myself.

And that’s what it’s all about.
