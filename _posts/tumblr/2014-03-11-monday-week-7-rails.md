Today began the start of Phase 3. That means that we’re actually getting to work with Rails. For a nine-week Ruby on Rails program, it’s a bit strange not to touch Rails until week 7. At least, that’s what I thought when I came into the program.

I understand why we didn’t see it sooner now, though. If we would have just learned about Rails on day 1, it all would have been magic. We would have had no context and no understanding of what was actually going on.

We would have been able to learn the tricks and the steps to get certain things done, but without the underlying base knowledge of Ruby, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Sinatra, we would have just been hacking.

We wouldn’t come out of the program as junior developers. We would have come out of the program as people who are able to make Rails do some fancy magic for us. But what happens one or three years from now, when Rails isn’t used anymore? Rails is an amazing tool, but languages and frameworks are constantly evolving, so it’s virtually guaranteed that we won’t be using Rails for forever.

If all we learn is Rails, I would be screwed when Rails inevitably falls out of favor.

Now, though, I have a solid base knowledge in all of these languages and frameworks. I understand programming concepts and principles. If Ruby falls to the wayside, I can still apply these principles to a new language or framework.

A few months before Dev Bootcamp started, I tried to work through Michael Hartl’s [Rails tutorial]. I copied and pasted his code without understanding hardly any of it. It was all magic that he had me copy into my files. I spent probably close to sixty hours on it and still didn’t finish.

Last weekend, I looked at it again. I skimmed through a quarter of the  chapters, stopping and reading whenever he was doing something that I didn’t understand. It took me about fifteen minutes to make it through.

I was floored by how much I understood. With just six weeks of work at Dev Bootcamp. Without ever looking at Rails.

New Cohort

This morning, a new cohort joined us. Last Friday, we said good-bye to the Sea Lions, and today, we welcomed the Fiery Skippers.

When the Golden Bears came in, I felt very anxious. I felt uneasy that I didn’t know all of their names, and I was scared that one of them would ask me a question that I would have no idea how to answer.

This morning, though, I was in an awesome mood. I woke up an hour before my alarm and felt completely awake. I folded my laundry from the night before. I got some yogurt, granola and fruit from La Boulange. I mailed Grace a letter for our anniversary. I made it to DBC by 7:45, and I watched some VSauce, which I haven’t gotten to do in months.

It was a solid morning.

And it got better. Shereef Bishay, the founder of Dev Bootcamp, spoke to us this morning.

He talked about something that I’d heard him speak about while I was preparing for Dev Bootcamp but hadn’t thought about since.

He spoke about the restaurant and kitchen mindsets. Basically, it’s easy to get into the mindset of a restaurant patron when we get to Dev Bootcamp. We read about the program. We saw the menu, which included Rails, JavaScript, and a focus on emotional intelligence. And for dessert, a job that pays somewhere around $80k. All for $12,000.

Sounds like a pretty swanky deal, so we pay our tuition and wait to get the learnings and the job. Just like someone ordering a meal at a restaurant.

But what if we come into Dev Bootcamp with a radically different mindset?  We could come in as cooks. We could walk straight back to the kitchen and work alongside the other cooks. Sure, some of the cooks started cooking earlier and were better than us, but we can all still be learning and teaching each other different cooking techniques.

If we wanted to taste a brand new meal that was off-menu, instead of trying to explain it to a waiter in the dining room, we could be in the kitchen making it ourselves.

It all comes down to owning our education. As a restaurant patron, we view the knowledge and job that Dev Bootcamp can offer us as something that we are owed because we paid the tuition. We fall prey to the just-world hypothesis, which is something that I talked about in my application video for Dev Bootcamp.

The world doesn’t owe us anything. We can pay $12,000 to attend a cool program, but that doesn’t mean we just get a job. How many people are spending ten times that amount or more to go to college?

We spend all of this money and think well, I deserve to get a job if I paid this much.



We aren’t owed anything by the universe. It’s on us. The people who get their dream jobs out of Dev Bootcamp are the ones who know that they aren’t going to get a job just because they signed up. They’re the ones who own their education. They roll their sleeves up and hop back in the kitchen with the chefs, experimenting and exploring and creating.

When I was listening to the talk, I was thinking about how Salar told a small group of us that we weren’t making enough projects on the side. We’re not experimenting enough. Not failing enough. For the most part, we’ve been getting these assignments, and we focus on them.

I won’t speak for everyone in my cohort, so I’ll just say that that’s what I’ve been doing. At night, when we’ve got work that we should be doing, I focus on that work instead of building my own stuff.

That’s not getting in the kitchen of the Dev Bootcamp restaurant. Expert chefs don’t follow recipes; they make their own.

So I’m going to start spending some time every night—at least a couple of hours—working on side projects for myself. Learning about topics that aren’t in the curriculum but sound like fun to me.
