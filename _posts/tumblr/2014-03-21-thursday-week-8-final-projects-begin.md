Today we started our final projects. We’ve now begun the last thing that we’ll be doing at Dev Bootcamp.

It’s the biggest project we’ve worked on by far, and it’s extremely exciting/terrifying. We have a week to build something. That’s our instruction. No more daily challenges and very few lectures. It’s just four groups of five boots using everything that we’ve learned to build a project.

Pitches

The day started off with pitches. Any boot who wanted to pitch an idea got the floor for one minute. We presented our pitches to all three of the cohorts and coaches, so it was maybe seventy people or so.

And I pitched! What? Week 1 Matthew would not have done that.

And even more surprising was how not terrified I felt when I was in front of the group. I kept my feet planted and didn’t sway (or, at least, I don’t think I did). I managed to make actual eye contact with some of the people in the audience, which I’ve always been a bit scared to do. I managed to look left and to look right. And I managed to deliver some jokes.

I felt confident up there. I wasn’t scared that I was being graded or being judged. I wasn’t scared about what I was going to say. I just did the best I could to deliver a fun pitch about Bookmeetups.

And it worked! The projects were voted on by all of the boots, and mine was voted as one of the top four. I now have the opportunity to work on making Bookmeetups look more how I had envisioned it when I worked on it a year ago.

And I get to do it with an awesome team, too. I think that we’ll be able to make something that we can all be really proud of.



Team Lead

I’m also excited to be team lead. I know it’s going to be really hard for me. I don’t know what all needs to go into this project. I don’t know how to manage everyone’s time and effort. I have trouble with being assertive. I’m not great at telling people that we need to move on when they want to keep talking. I’m not good at disagreeing with people and standing my ground. Usually, I’ll just let the other person have their way and quietly seethe with anger.



I mean, really, we’re all equals at DBC. We all just started eight weeks ago. No one has more power than anyone else. So it feels weird for me to be team lead and to be the one tell everyone that we need to move on or to have the final say on how we’ll implement a feature.

It’ll be an interesting week. While coding, I’ll also be trying to become more assertive, making decisions about the direction of the project, and having some difficult conversations. It’s gonna be uncomfortable.

But that’s the only time that we’re actually growing, so I’m really looking forward to the week ahead.
