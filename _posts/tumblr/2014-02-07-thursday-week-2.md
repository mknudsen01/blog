Another day gone at Dev Bootcamp. The days feel really long, but it’s mind boggling to think that I’m already nearly done with week 2.

I was texting with Grace earlier this evening, essentially freaking the bad word out. I told her about how I’m feeling like I’m drowning in all of the work and that there’s always so much to do and the pile just keeps growing and growing.

And she asked me what was most important for me to learn at Dev Bootcamp. What are the one or two things that I really want to get out of the program?

I really didn’t have a great answer. I just kind of always kept it as a vague I want to learn Ruby on Rails! kind of goal. But that’s a shitty goal. And so are some of the other goals I thought of — to “graduate” at the top of the cohort, to get a job within a couple of weeks, etc.

Those are all shitty goals. Back in business school, they taught us that goals needed to be SMART—specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-based.

Right now, the only goal that might qualify as SMART is to get a job within three weeks of finishing the program.

It might be a SMART goal, but it’s not a smart goal.

Johnny shared with the cohort a few days ago (or maybe it was last week) some of his learnings on goal theory.

There are three main types of goal theory: mastery goals, performance-approach goals, and performance-avoidance goals.

Mastery goals involve learning for the sake of learning. I try to master a topic because I want to learn about it. I find it interesting or useful, and so I want to pursue it.

Performance-approach goals are those that involve us wanting to do better than other people. We compare ourselves to our friends, classmates, coworkers or colleagues and gauge where we stand. Our goal might be to be better than them at something, so we spend time practicing or studying in order to become better than them. It’s not because it’s something we want to learn—it’s because we want to show off how good we are.

With performance-avoidance goals, instead of seeking to prove our competence, we attempt to prove that we’re not incompetent. It’s not that we want to be better than everyone else—we just don’t want to be worse than everyone. Like when your group is running away from a bear (because that happens)—you don’t need to be the fastest. You just need not to be the slowest.

Those are three ways to categorize goals. Of those three, mastery goals are the best. With mastery goals, you’re not seeking to impress anyone. You’re not working based on some external motivation—to get good grades, not to disappoint your parents, to make your parents proud, to get a trophy, or to be lauded by an audience or authority figure.

There’s no pressure. You’re not doing it for anyone else and you have confidence that you’ll learn it in a reasonable amount of time, so there’s no rush. So there’s no stress. So you’re happy when you’re learning. So it’s all a game.

And it turns out, when you’re in that state of play, you actually end up learning the most. If we’re operating with stressors, we might work more hours or work “harder,” but we’ll lose focus and retention.

My goal to get a job after DBC isn’t a mastery goal. It’s performance-based. I want to get a job because if I do, a company is saying that I’m good enough. I’m being validated. I’ll get money. I’ll have concrete evidence to back up the fact that I made a good decision to switch from accounting to programming.

Those are some pretty shallow reasons for wanting something. But that’s what I learned in school! Grades were always my motivating factor. I wanted to receive the praise and wanted to show everyone that I was smart and capable.

So my focus wasn’t on mastery; it was on learning the material well enough for the test so that I could get the grade and then forget about it. I didn’t develop a love of learning for learning’s sake. I never spent time learning something because I enjoyed it. There was always something to be studying to get my whatever-th A+.

I need to come up with a mastery goal for Dev Bootcamp. I’m going to talk to Sherif about it tomorrow, and hopefully he’ll help me tease out what I actually want from these nine weeks. That way, when I’m learning and coding, I might compare myself a little less to everyone else. I might stop worrying about what the teachers think of me and whether they think I’m a good coder. I’ll stop reading specific books because the teachers told us it would be a good idea. I’ll stop feeling guilty for not completing a challenge because I’ll realize it’s more important to learn what I want to learn than to check another challenge off the list.

Instead, I’ll start to follow whatever path my curiosity leads. I’ll start having debates about what I learn and ask earnest questions instead of the ones I  think will make me sound smart. I’ll not feel threatened by fellow boots who are better; rather, I’ll reach out to them to try to learn from them.

I’m sure it’s not easy just to switch to mastery goals instead of performance-based goals. The above change in actions and behavior would be the ideal, but that’s why they’re goals!

But they say knowing is half the battle. 50 percent? That’s almost 80 percent!

Since I know that I need to throw the external motivators to the wayside, I’m pretty much already there. Right, guys?

That’s how math works, right?

Please?
