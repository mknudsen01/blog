It’s Phase 2. Steven and Strand, our Phase 2 teachers, gave us an overview of what to expect over the next 3 weeks.

I thought Phase 1 was hard, but they’ve found a way to pack even more coding into this phase. We have lightning talks to prepare for (five minute lectures on a topic or question using only the whiteboard to explain yourself). We have pairing challenges every day. We have lectures every day. We have group projects that start on Fridays and continue into the weekend. And on top of that, we need to find the time to finish the ten portfolio projects that they’re going to hand out on Wednesday.

There’s going to be an even stronger feeling this phase that there’s always something to be doing. Unlike Phase 1, these assignments that we’re getting have deadlines. We need to produce group projects. We have to finish our portfolio projects by the deadline. We are required to research topics every week to give lightning talks. It’s going to be tough for me to find any time to relax when I know that there are five or six projects that need to get done.

I’m going to learn more and work harder in these three weeks than in any other three-week period of my life.

And now that I mention that, I realize that bar really isn’t super high. Sure, there have been weekends or weeks filled with tests where I had to cram and work late hours. But nothing has even come close to this. I’ve really not ever worked incredibly hard like this in my life.

It’s scary. It’s scary to think that probably six days of my week are going to be starting at DBC around 8 and ending around 11 or later. But it’s also rather exhilarating. I’m excited to push myself harder than I ever have and to learn more than I ever have. I can’t wait to see just how much I can learn in the rest of my time here at DBC.

The new boots, the Golden Bears, came in today, and it was a lot of fun to be on the other side of the fence during orientation. It was awesome getting to know what was coming next and getting to see how all of the boots responded. When I got to DBC on my first day, I was too terrified and nervous to be paying attention to what anyone else was doing. This time around, I just got to take it all in. It was great to look around the room and know nearly everyone’s name (except for the Golden Bears, of course). It’s only been three weeks, but so much has already changed.

And so we Banana Slugs got to give our “tweet-sized” bit of advice to the new boots, having been in their position only three weeks ago. I had the privilege of hearing the wise words of the Banana Slugs and of the DBC staff.

Those exchanges are my favorite. I like when talks go deep. I’ve never been one for small talk—it just seems like a waste of time to talk about the little polite nothings when I could be hearing about your dreams or your insecurities or your hopes or where you want to be in five years or your childhood or your thoughts on education or your stance on religion or how your life changed when you read a particular book or anything at all about which you care deeply (like Japanese selvedge denim). Those are the things worth talking about.

Of course, I could just be saying that because I suck at small talk. Maybe I’d change my tune if I excelled at it.

Either way, I had a lot of fun hearing everyone introduce themselves and share a little bit about themselves. From what little interaction I’ve had with the Golden Bears, they seem like an awesome group, and I’m excited to have them join the DBC family.

Tomorrow, we’re supposed to be building a basic version of craigslist. Tomorrow! After three weeks of programming at DBC, we already have the tools and the know-how to build craigslist! It just blows my mind.

Something tells me that it’ll be a long day, so I’m gonna scoot off to bed. Until tomorrow.
