I graduated from Dev Bootcamp!

Everything went really well on Friday. We had four groups, and we ended up with four awesome projects.

My group went first, and we presented Bookmeetups. I think everyone sounded confident, and the presentation was crisp and concise. Plus, the project turned out way cool.

The next group to go was Armando’s team, Glucose Amigo. This app was designed to help those with diabetes to track their sugar as well as send their scores to their doctors. It turned out to be an awesome app, and the team presented extremely well. They had the crowd laughing most of the time, and they still managed to teach us all about their application and show off the features.

Johnny and his team went next. They presented their application: Feed.me. You know how it’s always really difficult for a group or a person to decide where to go eat because everyone always says “I don’t care!”? Well, with this app, you click a button, and based on your Facebook information, it recommends a single restaurant choice for you.

And the last app to go was Irene''s BetterBet. This is an accountability app. I say what goal I want to achieve, and then I put money down. I make a bet with someone that I will stick to the goal. Maybe I’ll put $10 down that I need to work out 5 times this week. If I do it, I don’t lose $10, but if I don’t, the $10 goes to my accountability buddy. We don’t want to lose money, and it’s actually on the line, so we’re better about our goals.

All of the presentations were awesome. All of the groups were awesome. We all still suck at code, but it’s amazing to see how far we came in nine weeks.

Dev Bootcamp transformed me.

I came into Dev Bootcamp nine weeks ago as someone who just didn’t feel at ease. I couldn’t relax because I felt like I didn’t know anything. I felt boring. I was scared of my future. I didn’t think that I would ever have a job that I cared about. I was scared to speak loudly. I had next to nil confidence. I was a mess. I was unhappy with myself, and I felt that I was always searching. I didn’t love myself, and that makes it extremely difficult to love other people.

In Dev Bootcamp, though, I tried the “fake it ‘til you make it” stuff. I pretended to be confident and interesting, and then something happened. I started to be the real Matthew. I was loud. I made jokes. I started singing a lot, like I always do around my family and close friends.

Differences and small quirks are celebrated here. The boots are encouraged to be themselves, to expose their ignorance, and to be vulnerable.

And that let me be me. I was real Matthew, and people responded well. So I gained confidence.

I started to build real things out of nothing. I gained technical skills instead of some business skills. The accounting and finance skills that I learned didn’t really allow me to make anything, and I felt that I wasn’t actually contributing to society. But now I get to be creative and make stuff. So I gained confidence.

I’m excited about my future now. I know that I’m going to find a job, and I know that I’ll be working on building cool things. I’m going to get paid to continue learning and to have fun. What could be better?

i don’t feel much of a connection with my college. I didn’t feel much connection to my high school. I want to devote zero time and zero money to them.

But Dev Bootcamp is different. I want to make this awesome place even better. I’ll eventually have a job, but I can’t wait to come into DBC on nights and weekends to help out the boots. I can’t wait to share my ideas on how DBC can become even better.

I’m really excited for the future. I’ll get to help out at Dev Bootcamp. I’ll get to be employed doing something I really enjoy. I’ll get to be near most of the fantastic people I met here. And I’ll finally have money to fly out to see Grace! It still sucks that we can’t be together, but it’ll be great to have the ability to fly out and see her any weekend I want to.

Guys, Dev Bootcamp rules.
