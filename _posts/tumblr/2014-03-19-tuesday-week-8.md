When I built Bookmeetups, I had to use some crazy little thing called jQuery to trigger something crazy called AJAX to make the number of stars you rated a book change both in my database as well as on the screen.

It took me about two days to figure out how to make the clicking trigger with jQuery.

Today, I built a miniature version (like, super miniature) of jQuery in about five hours.

It was really hard. I’m not sure I understand a lot of what I did yet, but it’s crazy how much Dev Bootcamp has taught me.

It’s actually crazy. It’s dumb how much I’m learning now. To go from zero to building a javascript library with the module pattern in eight weeks.

And it’s also so much fun.

AND after I did that during the day, I worked on and—wait for it—finished (for now) my project!

Check it out: SF Bike Parking. If you’re not in San Francisco, it’s probably not going to work too well, as it only adds pins to San Francisco. You’ll have to move the map over to SF to find anything. And there’s a lot that it still can’t do, but there’s also a lot that it does.

It talks to Google Maps and SF Data to figure out where the user is, where the closest bicycle parking is, and shows the user directions to get there. I didn’t know that you could do so much with the Google Maps API, so it was kind of awesome. And I’ve only scratched the surface.

I’m super relieved to have the project marked ‘complete,’ at least until I’m done with Dev Bootcamp. It was adding a lot of stress, and I’m happy that I’m only going to focus on Dev Bootcamp homework tomorrow.

It was hard. But the really cool thing is that I used a bunch of technology that I’d never used before, and I didn’t totally fail. I wrote in a different programming language (Python), used a JavaScript framework (Backbone) I’d never seen, and used two APIs.

And I learned how to do all of this in less than 9 weeks. What’s going to happen when I have a few years under my belt?
