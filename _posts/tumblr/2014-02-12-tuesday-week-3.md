Well, today was quite the rollercoaster.

Things started out pretty fun! We learned about testing and followed along with Shadi as we created our own mini testing library. We’ll be using RSpec in the next few days and weeks (and for the rest of our careers), and the syntax and tests can kind of look like magic.

Shadi wanted to show us how to make a mini version with some live coding. We talked through the code and reasoned it out and created our own little testing library. It was kind of awesome to see it done.

Everything on the Internet always seemed like magic to me. I had no idea how websites worked. I couldn’t begin to imagine how an phone app might be made. When I install gems to use in my code, I typically just think of them as magic machines—my input goes in, some magic happens under the hood, and then magic data pops out. But every day here at DBC, the curtain is being pulled back.

On the one hand, it’s kind of like being Dorothy and the gang in Oz. There’s no real magic happening, and that’s a bit of a downer.

But ON THE OTHER, COOLER HAND, there’s no magic happening. That means that all of this knowledge is within my grasp. Muggles like me can learn all about all of these languages and concepts and actually make web applications. In a couple of weeks, I’ll be able to make craigslist and Twitter (at its most basic, anyway). And from there, we’ll learn more and experiment more until we can make awesome, complex websites (like this one that one of the coaches made at the end of his Dev Bootcamp experience).

It’s amazing, and I can’t wait to have the confidence and know-how (or at least the know-how to learn the know-how) to make whatever web application I can think of.

SO. Making the testing library was cool.

Then some bad stuff happened. We jumped from that basic library that we made to a challenge where we had to write a number of complex tests on some classes that were interacting with a database. It was the largest code base we’ve seen to date, and we only had a few hours to try to understand the code and write some tests for it with the new syntax that we’d learned that morning.

Of the probably 15 or 20 tests that we could/should have written, my partner Ivan and I made it through one. (Yay…) After lunch, we were supposed to be done with the testing and a good chunk of refactoring, so I was freaking out.

After lunch, though, Shadi and Sherif told us that they’d made some comments in the challenge and written some tests as a guide for us.

That made the sailing much smoother! We made it through most of what we needed to! Another up for the day.

Then another down. Or what I thought would be a down. Today was our next Engineering Empathy deep dive, and the cohort before us assured us that it was super intense and that pretty much everyone would be crying by the time it was over.

I had no idea what they were going to do to us in that session, so I was worried about it for a few hours before it happened and for pretty much the first half an hour of Karim’s talk.

I won’t divulge the details in case any future boots read this, buuuut the session turned out to be another high on the day. Some deep, emotional happenings and thoughts were shared, and the Sea Lions were not lying about the crying. I haven’t cried since I left Gracie to come out here to SF about three or four weeks ago, and it felt pretty good to get my cry on. People say that, right? “Get my cry on?” Please?

And afterwards, even though we’re all way behind on coding and have a bunch to do, we took a break for dinner. Maybe 10 or 12 dudes (and Raorao!) all went out to some (crappy) Irish pub for dinner, and it was really great just to sit around and talk with them.

I really didn’t think about the mound of work that I had waiting for me back at Dev Bootcamp the entire time we were at dinner. I felt fully present, and it was just fantastic. I’m not sure that I’ve really felt present for a while, as I’m usually thinking in the back of my mind that I should be working or spending time on something else. But at dinner, I was fully content with where I was at, and I was having a good time.

I would really like to be feeling that feeling all of the time, so we’ll try to make that happen. I’m not sure what did it. It could have been the crying. It could have been hearing about some of the deeper things I heard during the EE session and being reminded that there are some way bigger things to worry about than coding challenges. Or it could have been that there wasn’t anything that sounded more fun or more interesting than joking around with the truly awesome people surrounding me.

Whatever it was, I’m having a blast at this Dev Bootcamp thing.
