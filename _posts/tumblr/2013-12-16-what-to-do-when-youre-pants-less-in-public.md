Summer school, 2010. P.E. class in my school gymnasium.

We’re playing badminton. Why badminton? No idea. I think the first and last time I ever played badminton were during that class. After a few games, it just kind of turns into do-whatever-you-want time. Two female classmates call me over to do a net race.

I don’t know what a net race is, and they explain that it’s something they’d do for fun during volleyball practice when they had a short break.

To start the net race, I push each hand through a square in the bottom row of a volleyball net so that my hands are at the bottom of two columns of the little squares. To win the race, I was to weave my hands back and forth through the horizontal ropes of my two columns to the top of the volleyball net before my opponent. So, I was supposed to go through the front of the bottom square, through the back of the second square, through the front of the third square, and so on.

They show me a quick demo. Psh, I think to myself, I’m gonna crush them. So, we start the race, and I’m just laser-focused on getting to the top of that net first. It’s harder to weave my way up the column than I thought that it would be, but I’m still chugging along at a respectable pace. I get about three quarters of the way up the net when I look over at my opponent.

She isn’t even racing.

Uh-oh. Something’s up.

My opponent looks behind me with a less-than-innocent expression, and I see the other girl coming up behind me. And then tragedy strikes.

In a flash, I go from winning a net race to standing in the gym with my pants down and my arms caught three quarters of the way up a volleyball net.

Goddammit. The whole race was just a prank to pants me.

It was a good one, too. Usually when someone gets pantsed (is that a word? We’ll go with yes.), he or she just pulls his or her pants back up and carries on his or her merry way. For this pantsing (on second thought, it definitely doesn’t look like a word), though, it took me a good ten or fifteen seconds to get my arms out of the net so that I could pull my pants up.

Let’s pause here. Put yourself in that situation. Or one that’s equally or more embarrassing. How do you respond to the shame that you feel?

You could yell at the girls for being so cruel—just ask them, to quote T-Swift, “Why ya gotta be so mean?”

Option two is not to say anything to the girls but rather be self-critical for the rest of the day—How could I be so stupid?! What the hell was I thinking? Dammit, I’m such an idiot! I’m always a stupid idiot. if I just would have seen right through their half-assed prank, I could have avoided all of this.

The third choice is to just leave the room. All of the laughing and shame are in the gymnasium, so things will be better if we could just go out into the hallway.

Finally, you could just try to numb the pain. Maybe have a few extra brownies at lunch or drink like, five of those half-pint chocolate milks. HEY, LUNCH LADY, I’M AWARE THAT I GOT 5 CHOCOLATE MILKS. DON’T BE A TURD AND ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME. I HAD A TOUGH DAY. Or maybe if you’re cooler than tenth-grade Matthew, you go smoke a cigarette or sneak some alcohol or drive over the speed limit on the ride home.

Which one’s closest to the mark for you? Remember now, ten or fifteen seconds struggling to get your arms free. With your pants down. In the gym. In high school.

It was rough, guys.

I got hot and started to sweat. My face, as it was wont to turn red in my grade school and high school years at the slightest hint of embarrassment, turned a deep, beet red. I’m on the verge of tears while the girls look on and laugh. Then after five years or so, I finally got my hands out of the net and pulled my pants up.

I personally chose a combination of running away from the room, followed by telling myself that I was the biggest dumbass in all the land for the next week or three.

Some Background on Shame

The word “shame” is thought to have its origins in a word that meant “to cover.” I certainly wanted to cover myself as I stood with my arms caught in the volleyball net, so I can only assume that whoever coined the word dealt with a situation similar to my own when he or she was in high school.

We want to cover ourselves when we feel shame because we feel exposed. Sometimes it’s a physical exposure, but it may also be emotional.

Shame may pop up in any situation of humiliation, disgrace, dishonor, embarrassment, or inadequacy. A part of us that we normally refrain from showing others is now being shown to someone or to a group of people. We share a dark memory from our past and are laughed at. We raise our hand in class to ask a question, and everyone thinks it’s stupid. We get a poor performance review or get fired. We get drunk or high before a big event and make a fool of ourselves. We’re extremely nervous for a class presentation, and our voice cracks HARD while we’re presenting.

We’re constantly cultivating an image for others. We reveal certain facts or sides of ourselves based on who we’re around. When a part of us that we didn’t intend to show or were hesitant to show reveals itself AND that revelation was not well-received, those lead to feelings of shame.

If we’re well-adjusted and have never had an issue with self-confidence or self-worth, we can just shrug off the embarrassment and remind ourselves that we are awesome. In the high school pantsless volleyball “race,” that might involve calmly pulling our pants up, laughing it off, congratulating the girls on their good prank, and cheerily moving on to play something else that doesn’t involve our pants around our ankles.

But if we’re human, then we might not immediately move to acceptance without any issue. We have to deal with this shame somehow.

Enter: the compass of shame.

The compass of shame—organized by Dr. Donald L. Nathanson—describes four different ways that we may deal with shame, arranged into the four cardinal directions on a compass—north, south, east, west.

On the compass, we can be dealing with shame in two ways at once, but in the same way that we cannot head northsouth or eastwest, we cannot simultaneously be on opposite “directions” of the shame compass.

The Compass of Shame

North: Withdrawal

The first way of dealing with shame is withdrawal—running out of the gymnasium, wanting only to crawl into a dark corner and die without ever speaking again. We hide from other people. We live in fear that our weaknesses will be exposed, so we withdraw from any situation that may involve another person potentially seeing a flaw in ourselves that makes us feel shameful.

With this direction, we have no one to talk to. We’re avoiding feelings of embarrassment (yay!), but it’s coming at the cost of connecting with others (not as yay!). Building strong bonds with other people can’t happen because we either avoid speaking with them or fail to hear what they’re saying because we’re too busy worrying that they’ll ask us an embarrassing question that will lead to us being exposed.

South: Avoidance

At the south pole of the compass, we have avoidance. Whereas withdrawal attempts to avoid others seeing or finding out about our shameful characteristics, avoidance attempts to divest ourselves of all feelings of shame.

This can come in two flavors: forgetting and distracting.

Distracting involves hiding our flaws by showing off our strengths. You’ve probably got a “friend” who is always one-upping or talking about how interesting his or her life is. Blech.

While they’re talking about how totally rad their life is, they’re avoiding telling you some of the more embarrassing things, like about that one time they got pantsed in gym class.

Those people are putting a wall up, trying to show and tell the world how great everything is so that no one will slip behind the wall and see what sad, dry, shriveled being lives inside.

If we put this wall up, we’ll never really get to know each other. Part of the reasons that my childhood friends are still some of my best friends is because we went through the awkward and embarrassing moments with each other. Would you consider yourself better friends with the person who still wanted to eat glue even after you told him or her your deepest, darkest secret, or the dude who’s always asking you how your weekend was but not really caring and just waiting for you to ask him how his was so that he can tell you about how he and his bros all went out drinking Friday and Saturday night and just had the best time and did 20 shots and drank 15 beers apiece and hooked up with all the chicks?

You certainly run a risk by opening yourself up and making yourself vulnerable to humiliation, but that’s how you make your strongest bonds, too. No one wants to be friends with that work guy, Chet.

The second flavor, forgetting, involves using substances to forget about your shame. We might use drugs or drink or eat a lot of junk food to forget about how our voice cracked during our presentation and we could see everyone trying really hard to stifle the giggles because we had to be a silent audience or else lose points on our own presentations and somehow that just made the shame worse than everyone laughing loudly about it. Or about how the guy or girl we like rejected us or how our boss caught us picking our nose. We distort our consciousness so that we cannot remember the shame.

If we can’t even think of the shame, then it’s not there, right?

Right?

Please?

East: Attack Self

To the east, we have my personal method of dealing with shame: attacking ourselves by putting ourselves down. This one can come in the form of self-deprecation.

It’s something that we (or at least I) do quite often, like when I would go golfing last summer with people from my job at PwC. They had all gone golfing a fairly regular amount during the past few years and as such, were better than I was. So, the first time we went, before my opening tee-off, I had to make sure that I alerted everyone that I hadn’t been golfing in quite some time and wouldn’t be very good.

Then, when I inevitably shanked the bleep out of my drive, I could just say “Told you so! LOL” and make a joke out of it. Since I was the first one to make fun of myself, when people thought I was bad, they were joining my team instead of being against me.

This way of dealing with shame can be rather unhealthy, though. Sure, we’re putting ourselves down in front of everyone else to get a laugh or to cushion the blow that will come when our flaws are inevitably exposed, but we’re still not in a good place in our heads.

After I would make the shot and get the laughs, I would still feel shitty that I wasn’t as good a golfer as the others. With those constant feelings of inadequacy on the course, while I was outwardly having fun, things could get somewhat miserable on the inside.

Man, if I could just be a better golfer, then I wouldn’t feel as dumb. But I am a shitty golfer. Frick, how did he get to be so good at golfing? He’s already better than me at so many other things. Why is he better at this too? I just suck.

This one can also just come from believing someone who says something bad about us. If someone says that we’re stupid, or that we’re dull, or that we’re not funny, then we just take that statement and regard it as true. We will really believe that this one person who said we weren’t smart was right, and all of the previous experiences we have that would point to the contrary never actually happened. We aren’t smart, we never were smart, and we can never hope to be smart.

Attacking ourselves leads down the road of wildly diminished self-confidence with any activity or facet of our character. If we put ourselves down (either aloud or in our own heads), we’ll truly start to believe that we’re inadequate. Not just with golfing or whatever activity causes us to feel the shame. No, the feelings of inadequacy will bleed over into pretty much every aspect of our lives if left unchecked.

West: Attack Others

That bully in grade school who was always picking on you for being smart or for liking Hello Kitty (yeah, my little sister watched it and I kind of liked it, so sometimes I would push her towards watching the show so that I could watch it, too. What of it?) or Yu-Gi-Oh? He or she was probably dealing with some pretty serious feelings of shame and just lashed out at others to try to feel better. If we’re at a 4 and that snooty smart kid is walking around at a 7, if we can bring him down to our level or maybe even to a 2 or 3, then that means we’re happier than him! So, we win, right?

And if someone attacks us, be it emotionally, psychologically or physically,  we might lash out, usually in the form of a personal attack. “Oh yeah? Well, at least I don’t have giant ears, Dumbo!”

Usually, we get angrier and more defensive when we know the other person is right. We have shame, knowing that one of our flaws has been exposed, so we attack back to make the other person feel more shame than us. Then they’re just busy feeling bad about their shame, and we no longer have to deal with our own feelings of shame! Zero negative repercussions!

Getting off of the compass

While I think some directions and direction combinations may be worse than the others, not one of them is particularly good. All of the cases do either you or someone else a disservice.

I’m still on the compass a lot of the time (east is typically my direction of ‘choice’), but I’m working to get off of it and ‘blaze my own trail’—one which, if we’re extending the traveling and compass metaphor, would have to..not go in any of the cardinal directions..

And you can make up a new direction, too!

You mean I’m not forever destined to deal with my shame in a negative way?!

Indeed, fair reader! I do mean that.

It’s not a problem that you can just solve overnight. But the next time shame comes up—maybe someone criticizes you or you’re asked an awkward question—just notice your impulse. Just notice that you want to throttle the person who called your art derivative and tell him all of the ways his art sucks.

There’s no shame in having the impulse. You’ve been using these four techniques your entire life, and you’ve still turned out pretty not awful. So don’t just try to expel the impulse and make a sweeping declaration never to feel urge to go any of the four directions. Rather, try to point it out to yourself. Oh, I’m feeing the urge to run away from this awkward situation right now.

Once you recognize the direction you want to go on the compass, pat yourself on the back for seeing it. Then once you’re noticing the impulse most of the times you feel exposed, try to make the choice NOT to go in that direction. You’re in control, not your shame reaction impulses.

Are you going to have a 100% success rate? No, far from it. But trying and failing to reach the that mark can’t be worse than making yourself feel like garbage for three weeks because you got your pants pulled down in gym class.
