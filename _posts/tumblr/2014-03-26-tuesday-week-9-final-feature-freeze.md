Today was our last day to add new features to our websites. Coming into this project, I thought that we would be able to add new features up until our presentations.

Nope! We present on Friday morning, but we’re not allowed to add code either Wednesday or Thursday. And the reason’s pretty simple.

If we were allowed to keep adding features, we would.

Right up until the end.

And then we would get up to present, and something would break.

Our teachers are saving us from adding features and having no time to fix them. After today, we cannot add features. After tomorrow,we can’t touch the code at all.

Thursday is a day to take off from writing code. It’s a day to prepare presentations for the project. It’s a day to reflect on how the project went. It’s a day to sleep, since we haven’t been getting much. It’s a day to see our site and to decide which features we would most like to brag about.

I’m ready for it to be over. I’m ready for sleep. The team has been working some fairly crazy hours, and we’ve been working harder in those hours than we have with our other projects. This final push is by no means sustainable, and I think it’s starting to show. Everyone’s been a bit more on edge, more irritable, and more slap-happy.

I’m pretty sure at the very least we’ll all be taking a nap today.

I know it’s just a sprint to get the project done and that it’s part of finishing Dev Bootcamp, but life has really fallen out of balance for this final project.

Exercise?

Nope.

Extended lunch breaks?

Think again!

Guilt-free naps?

What are those?

Blogging?

Sadly, not enough.

Showering?

I wish! (Just kidding on the last one. Hopefully it won’t come to that.)

It’s just been a tough week. For about four days in a row, I’ve had a fairly constant low level of panic that we either won’t finish or that we won’t have a cool product to show off. It’s made us work harder, but it’s also made me have less patience. I’ve been on edge and feeling stressed, which is never the best way to feel. It’s way more fun to feel care-free.

We’ll try to pick that back up tomorrow. Because at the end of the week, we’ll present our projects. We’ll be done. And in a week, we’ll think that all of our code is garbage anyway. So who cares!

Anyway, we didn’t really add many features today. It was the last day to do so, but we focused on testing and styling for the most part.

As our teachers told us, it’s better to have 3 features that are 100% tested and working than to have 10 features at 90% each. If it breaks at all during the presentation or in use, no one will use the site. If they’re only 95% finished, they might as well be 5% finished.

It’s easy to continue adding features, to say wouldn’t it also be cool if… But we can’t! If we do, some stuff will hit the fan. We’ll have zero hours to fix and to test all ten of our features and to style the entire site.

It’s all about striking a balance. And it’s not something that we would have done by ourselves, so it’s a good thing that the teachers put this feature freeze into place.
