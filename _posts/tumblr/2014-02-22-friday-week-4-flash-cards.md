Today, our assignment was to work on a group project. We were to have a team of six work on making a flash card web application.

When Steven told us about it, he said that we would have until 5pm to create a minimum viable product. The time in the morning that we had (about 11 to 12:30) was to be spent on planning, with the rest of the afternoon to be spent on working on the project.

The planning went well, overall. I was reintroduced to the idea of kanban. I’d heard about it in my supply chain management courses back in college and kind of forgot about it. In software development, it’s a way of managing projects that have a lot of moving parts. On the board, we’re supposed to put a bunch of user stories that relate to different features or functionalities that users should experience on our application. As a user, I am able to create an account. Or As a user, I can play a round of flashcards. As a user, I can create a deck and add cards to it. And then someone will pick a task that sounds interesting to him or her and move it to in progress.

The idea is that each of these tasks is modular. There isn’t supposed to be a whole lot of overlap between them, so it’s possible that teams can work remotely. They will create their functionality by knowing only what their input will be as well as what output they will produce. In this way, one person doesn’t get stuck on just writing tests or on seeding the database. Instead, everyone gets to work from start to finish on their feature.

Everyone gets practice with testing. Everyone gets practice writing and designing. Everyone can work on modularized pieces of code that will all stitch together fairly easily at the end with reasonable assurance that it will work.

It’s a radical shift from what we’d be doing in the past on our projects. Usually, we’ve been splitting the work around the three components of our projects: Model, View, and Controller.

The view deals mostly with how the application will look. The model is the logic that finds and manipulates data. And the controller is the middle person who receives the model’s output and sends it to the view to be shown on the application. We always thought, Hey, we’ve got three people. Let’s split it along those three components!

That’s not always a great idea. It may have worked for some of our applications, but as they get more and more complex, that way of splitting it up makes less and less sense.

So, we logged on to Trello and wrote out our user stories for features that we wanted our flashcard application to have.

I was feeling pretty good at around 12:15 or so. We were getting the database figured out and had all of the features we wanted for the presentation at 5. I thought Oh, over four hours to make the MVP. That should be fine!

Then I remembered that we have lunch until 2.

And then we have lightning talks and lecture until 3.

Soooo it turns out that we really only had two hours to finish our MVP. And with the time crunch and only really have one basic feature, the six of us decided to split the work essentially on the Model, View, Controller lines.

It didn’t go too well. The model pair got done rather quickly and didn’t really have much else to do, and the view and controller pairs (I was in the controller pair) were having some trouble.  We realized that we were making our game far too complex. So, at around 4 when Hunter and I only had a few way of not getting the flashcards to work, I started to freak out a bit.

The 5pm deadline was an arbitrary time that Steven chose. We have all weekend to finish the project, so the MVP presentation really didn’t even matter. But for some reason, I wasn’t realizing that. All of my self-worth was on the line. If we didn’t get this MVP working by 5, I was a failure.

I’m not entirely sure why I was being so dramatic. But I was starting to get extremely antsy. I was having trouble focusing whenever I didn’t immediately understand what Hunter was trying to do with the code. I came pretty close to losing it. And again, I’m not really sure why. There would be no negative repercussions if we didn’t have a minimum viable product working at 5pm.

I was just frustrated that we had so little time to code. I was frustrated that none of my ideas were working. I just got so close to the code and was so attached to the idea of what we had discussed should be the minimum viable product that I wasn’t being flexible or thinking clearly. I was trying to force it.

We were making our code way too complex for the absolute minimum product that would suffice. So, in the last half an hour or so, we made things a lot simpler and got our MVP up and running.

Then after our presentations, after getting away from the code a bit, I had an idea as to how we could solve the problem that we were having. The team talked about what went wrong in the afternoon and how we could make the rest of the project go more smoothly. It was a great chat, and we all got back on the same page.

We split up the tasks based on features this time. And most of the bare minimum tasks to complete the project got done last night. We were pretty close to solving the problem when I was having my freakout. After the break, everyone got to work, and we’ve already got a product already up and running. The rest of the weekend is just here to polish it up, refactor the code, and add some cool features.

I feel really good about the application now. I was worried that we would have to work 20 more hours on it or something ridiculous to even get it up and running. But using the kanban system, I think everyone put in two or three hours on their own, and we’ve already got something that works.

It was really cool to see the shift. To see how much more productive we all were when we got to pick entire tasks that sounded interesting and got to handle them from start to finish, as opposed to splitting between logic, aesthetics, and the go-between.

I’m no longer feeling worried about the project and am super excited to add some cool features to it with my team. I just need to chill out and remember that I’m not being graded here. I don’t work well when I’m stressed. If I don’t have something done by a deadline, the world will keep spinning. All of the stress is created by me, and it makes the programming less fun. When I’m not feeling stressed, coding is so much fun. When I freak out, coding sucks. And the only difference between being stressed or not stressed is myself. I’ve got the power to make it fun all the time.
