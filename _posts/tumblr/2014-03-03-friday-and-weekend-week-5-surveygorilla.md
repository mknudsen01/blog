Week 5 is over!

Friday

On Friday, we got our second team project. For this project, we were supposed to create a basic version of SurveyMonkey. Users can create an account and then make and take surveys.

This was the biggest project we’ve done to date, and it was a lot of fun to get started on it. This project would combine all that we learned about Sinatra and making basic applications in Week 4 with all that we learned about jQuery, JavaScript, and AJAX in Week 5.

Friday was awesome once we started working on the project.

The shitty part, however, was that we were all supposed to pick our own groups. 23 people told to split up into 5 groups. I dislike being told to pick my own group, as it causes unnecessary stress. When we’re assigned groups, maybe we’re not super stoked about the group, but we know that no one had a choice in it. We can blame the randomness of the universe for making us work with that one person with whom we cannot stand to work.

There’s no pressure. You’re told who your teammates are, and you just deal with it.

When it’s a matter of picking your own teams, it’s like trying to find a seat in the cafeteria at school in pretty much every teen movie. You walk up to a table, try to be friendly, ask if you can join the table. Or it’s like having to pick teams for sports. It feels really great to be one of the first picks.

BUT. What if you’re not one of the first picks? What if you get rejected by one or a couple teams because they’re already full? And then because you wasted time asking those couple of groups, all of the other groups have filled up? What if no one looks at you across the room and give you the let’s be on the same team, homes head nod?

A few people end up really happy about their teams. But some people end up on teams they don’t like because the teams they wanted to be on were full. Or because no one expressly picked them for a team. And that feeling of getting rejected or of feeling unwanted is no way to start a huge team project.

That’s what I figured would happen to me when they announced that we would be picking our own teams. I thought that I would end up on no team and just somehow wind up with the three or four people with whom I found it the most difficult to work. Not really a great thing to jump to immediately, so I’m going to have to continue to work on that.

I was lucky enough to end up with an awesome team—I worked with Stephen, Johnny, Phil, and Jamie, which is kind of an all-star team. I was really happy.

But I know that not everyone in the cohort was as happy with his/her team as I was with my team. And that seems shitty. We didn’t come to DBC to have to feel like an outcast or an unwanted, so it was really sucky that not everyone got to be on a team that they loved. Feeling that way just brings on the superego attacks (Why didn’t people want me on the team? Why didn’t I get picked? Do I really suck that bad? Do people not like me?), and that can ruin the entire project.

Anyway, Friday went really well. We spent a bunch of time on the planning phase. We talked about our workflow, set up our Trello board, drew out our database, created our models, and talked about our MVC and our stretch goals.

Having all of that setup before we started working made it really easy to get started on the work. This time, we were careful to make all of the tasks modular. The task that I’m working on won’t involve changing any of the data that someone else is working with, so there are fewer conflicts when we try to merge all of the code. It worked, and everything went pretty smoothly.

Around 8 or so, we stopped with the laser-focused work on our team project. We kind of left the night open—we could work on our portfolio challenges, continue on the group project, or just kind of take it easy. I wanted to get the portfolio projects all finished so that I wouldn’t have to worry about them for the rest of the weekend.

That didn’t really happen, though.

Instead, we made a beer run and just kind of hung out and chatted and did a little bit of work. And then a small group up us ended up playing Cards Against Humanity at around 12:30. Guuuys, that game’s so much a fun.

We’re supposed to be out of the place by 2am, buuuuut Johnny and I ended up spending the night in the Cave (a little room where most of Phase 1 is spent). We’d been told that the Cave didn’t have any motion sensors in it, so we could sleep there instead of leave for the 2am to 7am “don’t be in DBC” time.

Dev Bootcamp is moving next weekend, so this was going to be our last chance to spend the night there! So we did. We ended up watching House of Cards until about 4, and while it wasn’t super comfortable, it was a lot of fun.

The rest of the weekend

Saturday had a slow start. Staying up until four isn’t conducive to getting up early, so Johnny and I didn’t up until around 10:30 or 11. Then Armando, Quentin, Johnny and I got some breakfast at La Boulange.

It was delicious, as always. I did accidentally order a shot of espresso when I meant to order a cappuccino, though. It was kind of gross. But the cheese Danish and the ham and potato tart were awesome.

Then an alum gave us a really cool lecture on JavaScript. He live-coded an app for us, and I understood what was going on for pretty much the entire time, which was really cool.

The rest of the day was spent working, though. I got a few portfolio challenges done, and we started group work at around 5.

Then today, I managed to finish the last portfolio challenge! I’m pretty excited about the end result. We had to make a todo application that could add, complete and delete todo tasks. It was all linked up to a database AND it makes all of the corresponding changes to the HTML and CSS. With AJAX, JavaScript and jQuery, it does everything on a single page. You can check it out here: Todo App. There’s certainly room for improvement (for instance, if you leave the page, while the data is still in the database, it doesn’t show up on the page), but it was a lot of fun to make. Oh, and the todo items are draggable, so that’s kind of awesome.

This is the stuff I want to do! I get to work hard, have fun, learn a bunch, and end up with a cool thing at the end that I made. It’s not even work. It’s just exploring and having fun.

After I got that challenge done, I refactored two of my other portfolio challenges to make them a little more polished. And we finished our group project. Everything worked out kind of perfectly.

This weekend was kind of great. I had a great time with my team. Everyone worked hard, and we made a sweet application that was more complex than anything else we’ve made. I made steady progress on my portfolio challenges. I didn’t feel stressed, rushed or worried. It was just a fun weekend.

I’m feeling more confident in my abilities, and I’m super excited to keep building cooler, more complex, more polished applications. This week, we’re not supposed to be getting any new topics—we’re just going to be doing some deeper dives on the topics that we’ve learned in the last couple of weeks. It’s gonna be awesome.
