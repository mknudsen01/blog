Week 5 begins. We’re not learning Ruby this week. It’s all about JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. We’re learning how not to write crappy JavaScript as well as how to make the front ends of our web applications not suck.

It’s gonna be a really cool week. Before I got my Dev Bootcamp study materials, I tried studying JavaScript. I had a lot of fun working on Project Euler in JavaScript, even though I didn’t make it very far.

So far, JavaScript is awesome. Steven gave us an awesome lecture this afternoon about object-oriented JavaScript, and I’m surprised at how easy it is to pick up on some of the concepts. We have a solid foundation in programming principles from studying Ruby. While Ruby and JavaScript are by no means the same language, there’s a lot of overlap. It’s making it a lot easier to pick up on all of the basics.

We’ve covered quite a few topics so far in Dev Bootcamp. Some people are starting to become the resident experts on certain topics. So-and-so is great at testing. If you need to learn about object-oriented programming, talk to person. Male boot 4 is really good at knowing technical intricacies of the languages and topics we study. Female boot 2 has ActiveRecord ON LOCK.

I’ve got mixed feelings about it. I’m happy that they’re successful. I’m excited that they’re doing well and are exploring what inspires them and are learning more about it than the rest of us.

And i’m also scared about it. I’m scared that I don’t have that one thing that I’m good at. I want to be good at it all. And I’m letting myself be pulled in five directions at once, trying to get better and better at each thing.

I’ll start to work on something, and then a little attack from the ol’ superego will happen: So-and-so is better than you at that other thing. Why are you even here if you’re just behind everyone at everything? And then I feel stressed about not working on the other thing and lose focus on the first thing!

What the heck?

It’s that silly superego. Sefora (the DBC counselor) and I were chatting about it today. The superego typically has some crappy logic. It’s little kid logic. Bloop is better than you at A. And derp is better than you at B. Ergo you’re bad at ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, will never amount to anything, and are deserving of much public ridicule.

It’s stupid that we let the superego have power over us. Sefora had me pretend to be my superego and talk to myself.

And it’s such a silly exercise! When I have to put to words these disparaging remarks that my superego throws out at me, I just hear how lame they are. It’s an abusive relationship—this thing that pretends to be my buddy but constantly seeks to make me feel bad.

Were my superego a person, I would not associate with him. So why let him stick around in my mind? Why not challenge him? Why not put a friend in my mind, too? Someone who will interrupt the superego and tell him that he’s being mean. The friend who can shoo him away so that I can talk with someone who’s not a jerk.

I do think that I’ve come a long way since high school and college, though. The attacks were more frequent and more debilitating then, and  I’ve made a lot of progress since getting to Dev Bootcamp.

But something about everyone gaining all of these proficiencies has started a resurgence of the attacks.

And I’m just at a “Fuck this” moment with the superego. My fellow boots developing these varied proficiencies is a huge opportunity for me. I can learn from them.

I’m not in competition with them. Superego would have me think that Dev Bootcamp is a direct competition with 22 other people. But it’s impossible to compare programmers like that. There’s no race. It’s just 23 Banana Slugs all trying to learn as much as they can, together. And we’ve got Sea Lions, Golden Bears, teachers and coaches to support us, to guide us, and to cheer us on.
