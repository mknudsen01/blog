Guuuuys, Dev Bootcamp is getting haaard.

And I kind of love it. At the moment, we’ve got six assignments that are due by Sunday night. That would all be fine IF we didn’t have our other daily assignments. We had four daily challenges yesterday that took up pretty much the entire day. And we have a group project starting today that will likely go into the weekend.

So, when do we work on the six assignments that are due Sunday? Good question! Late at night.

Yesterday was probably my latest night here, leaving at around midnight thirty. A handful of the Banana Slugs were here until then. It was really cool. People were throwing out questions and walking around helping each other and rushing to get all of our daily assignments and portfolio projects finished.

This is how I had originally envisioned Dev Bootcamp would be. Early mornings and late nights filled with working on hard code. A lot of boots managed to get out of Dev Bootcamp before 9 most days in the past, and the rest of the lot would typically be gone by 10 or 10:30. Then we would all get our solid 8 hours of sleep.

Which is good. Which is healthy. Which allows us to take care of ourselves. We need the time and sleep to recharge.

Buuuuut then there’s part of me that thinks Hey, you paid a lot of money to be here, and you’re really not working as hard as you can if you’re leaving before 10 every night. You’ve only got nine weeks here. It’s kind of the you can sleep when you’re dead mentality.

And I’m aware that lifestyle would not be sustainable. But getting a few less hours of sleep every night to learn more sounds awesome to me. This stuff is addictive. Today, we added on to the blog that we made yesterday. Now we use sessions and user authentication on our blog, which allows us to have users sign in. We give users access to create posts only if their signed in. We have an author for each blog post now, and the posts may only be edited or deleted by the original author. We handle errors for users when they try to create a blog post without a title or without content. (I’ll put it on the Internet in the next couple of days, hopefully.)

We also made a baby version of Bitly. I worked on that challenge with Quentin, and we knocked it out in about an hour. We made Bitly in an hour. In our fourth week at Dev Bootcamp! What?

Every day, we’re making our web applications more and more complex. And we’re getting faster at doing it.

If a couple extra hours every night will get me to making super web applications that much faster, I’m all for it. Yes, I was here late, but I was having fun the entire 17 hours I was here today. There were road blocks, challenges, and frustrations. My patience was tried, and my mind was pushed to the edge of its capabilities multiple times.

And I came out the other end knowing a heck of a lot more than I did yesterday. It’s amazing how quickly one learns here at Dev Bootcamp. And how much fun learning really can be when you’re learning something that you really like, surrounded by other motivated people who really like the topic, being taught by teachers and coaches who really love what they teach.
