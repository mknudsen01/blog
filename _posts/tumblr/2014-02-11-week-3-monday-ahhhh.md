Soooo today we started working in earnest with databases. And holy crap, did Dev Bootcamp get hard today.

I thought that things were bad weeks 1 and 2, but today we got 10 challenges in the afternoon on databases. After 3 hours, my pairing partner and I were through one and a half of the challenges.

There’s zero way I’m going to come anywhere close to finishing this evening, so I’ve just got to do some education triage.

Each of the ten challenges will teach us something different. Some are about reading and writing data from and to CSV files. Some involve using JSON. Some are focused purely on SQL queries. Some involve making the databases and writing the Ruby code to interact with the tables. And some involve scraping data.

Actually, judging by how late it is already, I probably won’t do anything with any of them this evening. I’m going to read through some of the code that the other boots posted for the three challenges that I DID complete and then call it a night.

Dev Bootcamp is an exercise in dealing with this feeling of drowning. They pile on so much work that it’s impossible to get it all done. But all of it’s important. You want to get it all done, but you really can’t.

And that’s been pretty hard to deal with. I was convinced that I would be able to handle anything that DBC threw at me. I’d be able to finish all of the assignments and finish all of my reading by staying up all hours of the night. It’s been tough coming to terms with that fact that I was completely wrong.

I’ve never not been able to get everything done before. I’m working towards feeling alright about not finishing all of the challenges, but on days like today where I only finished about 30% of the work, it’s a bit of a huge downer.

But what can I do? Either I can worry about it and feel guilty OR I can stop feeling shitty, be happy with what I am learning, and have the best freaking time I can at DBC.

Door number 2, please.
